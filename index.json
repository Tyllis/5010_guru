PURPOSE.  This circular is a reissuance of guidance (previously \u201cGrant Management Requirements\u201d) for post-award administration and management activities for all applicable Federal Transit Administration (FTA) federal assistance programs.  This revision incorporates provisions of the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) programs and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) programs.  This circular includes the most current guidance for the federal public transportation programs as of the date of publication.\nThis circular revision also incorporates provisions of U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d 2 CFR part 1201.  These regulations incorporate by reference the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d 2 CFR part 200, which supersedes and streamlines the former OMB Circulars on Uniform Administrative Guidance, A-102 and A-110, former OMB Circulars on Cost Principles,      A-21, A-87, and A-122, and former OMB Circulars addressing Single Audit issues, A-133 on Single Audit Act administration and A-50 on Single Audit Act follow-up.  OMB\u2019s final guidance consolidates the guidance previously contained in the aforementioned documents into a streamlined format that aims to improve both clarity and accessibility. The U.S. DOT adopts this guidance, with a few DOT-specific provisions.\nThe U.S. DOT regulations, 2 CFR part 1201, supersede and repeal the requirements of the former U.S. DOT Common Rules, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments,\u201d former 49 CFR part 18, and \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and other Non- Profit Organizations,\u201d former 49 CFR part 19.\nGrant Agreements and Cooperative Agreements awarded before December 26, 2014, however, shall continue to be subject to the former U.S. DOT Common Rules, 49 CFR parts 18 and 19, and OMB guidance in effect on the date FTA awarded federal assistance for such Grant or Cooperative Agreements.\nThese requirements are intended to assist recipients in administering FTA-funded projects and in meeting the responsibilities and reporting requirements of FTA Awards.  Recipients have a responsibility to comply with regulatory requirements and to be aware of all pertinent materials to assist in the management of their federally assisted Awards.\n2. CANCELLATION. This circular cancels FTA Circular 5010.1D, \u201cGrant Management Guidelines,\u201d dated 08-27-2012.\n3. AUTHORITY.  a. Federal Transit Laws, codified at 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.\nb. 49 CFR \u00a7 1.91.\n4. WAIVER. FTA reserves the right to waive any provision of this circular to the extent permitted by federal law or regulation.\n5. FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICE. In conjunction with publication of this circular, a Federal Register notice was published on January 13, 2017.\n6. AMENDMENTS TO THE CIRCULAR. FTA reserves the right to update this circular to reflect changes in other revised or new guidance and regulations that undergo notice and comment without further notice and comment on this circular.

The Scope of Work is a written set of expectations that form an agreement or understanding between the appraiser and the recipient as to the specific requirements of the appraisal, resulting in a report to be delivered to the recipient by the appraiser.  It includes identification of the intended use and intended user; definition of market value; statement of assumptions and limiting conditions; and certifications.  This agreement should specify the performance requirements, or it should reference them from another source, such as the recipient\u2019s approved Right-of-Way or Appraisal Manual.  The Scope of Work must address the unique, unusual, and variable appraisal performance requirements of the appraisal.  Either the appraiser or the recipient may recommend modifications to the initial Scope of Work, but both parties must approve changes.\n2. EXAMPLE.  The example below is intended to be a guide for recipients preparing a Scope of Work for real estate appraisals.   a. Scope of Work: The appraiser must, at a minimum:  (1) Provide an appraisal meeting the recipient\u2019s definition of an appraisal, or, at a minimum, the definition of an appraisal must be compatible with the definition found at 49 CFR \u00a7 24.2(a)(3).\n(2) Afford the property owner or the owner\u2019s designated representative the opportunity to accompany the appraiser on the inspection of the property.\n(3) Perform an inspection of the subject property.  The inspection should be appropriate for the appraisal problem, and the Scope of Work should address:  a) The extent of the inspection and description of the neighborhood and proposed project area,\nb) The extent of the subject property inspection, including interior and exterior areas, and\nc) The level of detail of the description of the physical characteristics of the property being appraised (and, in the case of a partial acquisition, the remaining property).\n(4) In the appraisal report, include a sketch of the property and provide the location and dimensions of any improvements.  Also, the report should include adequate photographs of the subject property and comparable sales and provide location maps of the property and comparable sales.\n(5) In the appraisal report, include items required by the acquiring recipient, usually consisting of the following:  a) The property right(s) to be acquired, e.g., fee simple, easement, etc.,\nb) The value being appraised (usually fair market value), and its definition,\nc) The appraisal of contaminated property that would get at the difference in value, were the property clean,\nd) The date of the appraisal report and the date of valuation,\ne) The realty/personalty report required at 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103(a)(3)(i)\u2013(v),\nf) The known and observed encumbrances, if any,\ng) The title information,\nh) The location,\ni) The zoning requirements and restrictions,\nj) The property\u2019s present use, and\nk) At least a 5-year sales history of the property.\n(6) In the appraisal report, identify the highest and best use.  If the highest and best use is in question or different from the existing use, provide an appropriate analysis identifying the market-based highest and best use.\n(7) Present and analyze relevant market information.  Specific requirements should include research, analysis, and verification of comparable sales.  Inspection of the comparable sales should also be specified.\n(8) In developing and reporting the appraisal, disregard any decrease or increase in the fair market value of the real property caused by the project for which the property is to be acquired or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for the project.  If necessary, the appraiser may cite the Jurisdictional Exception or Supplemental Standards Rules under Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) to ensure compliance with USPAP while following this Uniform Act requirement.\n(9) The appraiser\u2019s analysis, opinions, and conclusions must be included in the appraisal report.\nb. Additional Requirements for a Scope of Work: (1) Intended Use: This appraisal is to estimate the fair market value of the property, as of the specified date of valuation, for the proposed acquisition of the property rights specified (i.e., fee simple, etc.) for a federally assisted project.\n(2) Intended User: The intended user of this appraisal report is primarily the acquiring agency (ultimately the recipient), but its funding partners may review the appraisal as part of their program oversight activities.\n(3) Definition of Market Value: This is determined by state law, but includes the following:  a) The buyer and seller are typically motivated;\nb) Both parties are well informed or well advised, each acting in what he or she considers his or her own best interest;\nc) A reasonable time is al", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "8a2fd707-c7f7-4803-8eea-01c519a43976"}, "9068182438707255179": {"text": "lowed for exposure in the open market;\nd) Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and\ne) The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.\n(4) Certification: The required certification should be in the State\u2019s approved Appraisal Procedures or part of state law.\n(5) Assumptions and Limiting Conditions: The appraiser shall state all relevant assumptions and limiting conditions.  In addition, the acquiring agency may provide other assumptions and conditions that may be required for the particular appraisal assignment, such as:  a) The data search requirements and parameters that may be required for the project,\nb) Identification of the technology requirements, including approaches to value, to be used to analyze the data,\nc) Need for machinery and equipment appraisals, soil studies, potential zoning changes, etc.,\nd) Instructions to the appraiser to appraise the property \u201cAs Is\u201d or subject to repairs or corrective action, and\ne) As applicable include any information on property contamination to be provided and considered by the appraiser in making the appraisal.\n3. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.  One of the persistently difficult issues is the valuation of property with potential and/or known hazardous materials or contamination.  Therefore, it is important that the environmental conditions of all parcels considered for acquisition be assessed according to ASTM standards.  The following guidance will assist recipients in developing a Scope of Work for assessing the environmental conditions of parcels and for appraising those that are found to be contaminated or have hazardous materials present.\nRecipients must investigate the environmental conditions of all parcels proposed for purchase in order to identify potential contamination on the property.  This site investigation work includes conducting a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) (in accordance with ASTM standards) for all parcels.  If the Phase I ESA identifies potential contamination or recognized environmental concerns, a Phase II ESA should be conducted to confirm the presence and extent of any contamination.  The ESAs should have been completed as a part of the overall environmental review process undertaken during an early phase of the project.  If not, the recipient should conduct ESAs for all parcels prior to the appraisal.\nThe presence of contamination is regarded as a detriment to the property and should be handled like other negative characteristics or limitations of a property relative to the determination of its highest and best use (HBU) or greatest market value.  From an appraisal perspective, dealing with contamination is much like addressing other conditions affecting the use and value of the property.  It is FTA policy that the effect of contamination on the value of a property should be considered in the appraisal to the extent feasible.  If the contaminant is a detriment for the property, the reduction in value of the property attributable to that detriment should be considered by the real estate appraiser.\nAppraisers are not expected to be experts in the field of property contamination.  Therefore, the results of the previously mentioned ESAs must be provided to the appraiser before the appraisal work is initiated, whenever feasible.  The recipient or its environmental consultant should be available to answer any questions that an appraiser may have regarding the environmental testing report(s) that pertains to the HBU and the value of the property.  The appraiser is expected to be competent in the analysis of the impact of contamination on the value of the parcel being appraised.\nThe environmental reports, estimated remediation costs and specifications for the required remediation, along with any specific direction from the recipient regarding the applicability of state law or agency procedures related to the valuation of contaminated property, must be provided to the appraiser.  The existence of detrimental contamination must also be defined by the recipient in analyzing the approach to the appraisal problem.  The approach will necessarily involve an understanding of the purpose and use of the property within the context of the construction design plans of the project, specifically in terms of excavation that may be required for the intended use or use only as surface parking, as examples.  These issues as they pertain to the subject site should be included as an element of the appraisal Scope of Work that is mutually agreed to by the recipient and the appraiser.  Recipients must not offer a conclusion of the impact of the contamination, but should insist that the appraiser\nevaluate the value impact of its presence using the expert site reports and project construction plans.\nThe following guidance is offered to assist a recipient valuing a contaminated site.  It is general and broad.  FTA should be contacted for further specific direction.\na. For commercial/industrial properties: (1) Situation: The property contains contaminants or hazardous materials that must be mitigated before any use of the property is practical.  Approach: In cases such as this, generally, the cost to mitigate the contaminated materials to permit the HBU should be deducted from the potential estimated value to achieve that highest and best use.\n(2) Situation: The property is contaminated, but can be used at its highest and best use without remediation.  Approach: In this situation, the appraiser would value the property at its highest and best use and only make an adjustment if the market indicates such an adjustment is necessary.  Other similarly contaminated property would be a good indication of value and any further adjustment may not be required.\n(3) Situation: An improved property has building components that contain hazardous materials (asbestos, lead paint, etc.) and the market considers these items to be a detriment to value.  Approach: In this situation, the appraiser should consider the appropriate cost to cure such deficiencies, based on market dynamics.\n(4) Situation: The property formerly was contaminated but is now remediated.  Approach: In this situation, the appraiser should consider any residual \u201cstigma\u201d that might be caused by possible future requirements or the market resistance to such remediated properties when similar clean substitute properties are available.  Comparable sales of similarly remediated property would be the best indication of value.\nb. For residential properties: (1) Situation: The building contains hazardous material, but the market apparently does not adjust for such items (e.g., asbestos shingles, asbestos floor tile).  Approach: In this situation, the appraiser should note the items and note that the market does not make an adjustment for them.  Valuation would be unaffected by the presence of the contaminant in such a case.  If remediation is only necessary because of the development of the transit project, that remediation would be an eligible expense under the Award given that the expense cannot be recouped from the seller and would be needed for the project.\n(2) The building contains hazardous materials and the market typically requires remediation or adjustment (friable exposed asbestos, chipping lead paint).  Approach: In this situation, the estimated cost to cure the detriment to value should be considered and deducted from the value as clean, unless this cost to cure is greater than the present value of the structure.\nRegardless of the type of property, it is important that the effect on value of the contamination or hazardous material be measured by the impact on the value of the property assuming a typical market transaction based on HBU analysis and the degree of non-contamination dictated by the project construction specifications regarding construction activity on that parcel property.\nAPPENDIX E:   ROLLING STOCK STATUS REPORT\n1. GENERAL.  When an agency is disposing of vehicles that have met their minimum useful life that have a fair market value greater than $5,000, or is disposing of vehicles before they reach their minimum useful life, or is requesting a revision to the Award affecting those vehicles, the Rolling Stock Status Report (See example on next page) should include the following information:  a. Vehicle Number\nb. Year\nc. Make/Model\nd. Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)\ne. Date Placed in Revenue Service\nf. Date Removed from Revenue Service\ng. Minimum Useful Life (Years and Miles)\nh. Mileage (At the time Removed from Revenue Service)\ni. Total Number of Vehicles\nj. Total Number of Peak Vehicle Requirements\nk. Total Number of Spare Vehicles\n2. REPLACEMENTS AT THE END OF THE MINIMUM USEFUL LIFE.  Rolling Stock Status Reports must accompany a request for a replacement vehicle that has met its minimum useful life.  The report will be used to verify that a vehicle has met the minimum useful life and that there is no remaining federal interest.  Note: Though the remaining federal interest might be zero, if the asset\u2019s value exceeds $5,000, FTA may still be entitled to reimbursement.  See Chapter IV, subsection 4.o, \u201cDisposition of Equipment and Supplies,\u201d for more information about project property valued over $5,000.\n3. EARLY DISPOSITION.  Rolling Stock Status Reports must accompany a request for early disposition of vehicles.  The report will be used to verify the remaining federal interest in the vehicles.\n4. EXAMPLE.  An example of a Rolling Stock Status Report for vehicles pending disposal with and without remaining federal interest or budget revision affecting vehicles is shown on the following page.\nExample: Rolling Stock Status Report\nTransAmerica Buses\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nVeh #\nVehicle Year\nMake/Model or Vehicle Description\nDate in Service\nOut of Service\nFed Useful Life (yr)\nActual Service ", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "6020aa3b-6fce-4d0a-86c2-130d2d41a402"}, "7478831046765123890": {"text": "(yr)\nRemaining yrs\nRemaining % based on yrs\nActual Mileage\nMinimum Useful Life Mileage\nRemaining % based on miles\nTotal Federal Share\nRemaining Fed Share based on yrs\nRemaining Fed Share based on miles\n151\n2000\n30' New Flyers\n9/1/00\n9/1/07\n7\n7\n0\n-0.04%\n200,000\n200,000\n0.00%\n$120,000\n-\n-\n152\n2000\n30' New Flyers\n9/1/00\n9/3/07\n7\n7\n-0.01\n-0.12%\n200,000\n200,000\n0.00%\n$120,000\n-\n-\n154\n2000\n30' New Flyers\n9/1/00\n9/2/07\n7\n7\n-0.01\n-0.08%\n210,000\n200,000\n-5.00%\n$120,000\n-\n-\n155\n2000\n30' New Flyers\n9/1/00\n9/2/07\n7\n7\n-0.01\n-0.08%\n205,000\n200,000\n-2.50%\n$120,000\n-\n-\n156\n2000\n30' New Flyers\n3/1/01\n3/1/06\n7\n5\n2\n28.53%\n140,851\n200,000\n29.57%\n$120,000\n$34,239\n$35,489\n157\n2000\n30' New Flyers\n3/1/01\n3/1/06\n7\n5\n2\n28.53%\n154,649\n200,000\n22.68%\n$120,000\n$34,239\n$27,211\n158\n2000\n35' Flexible\n3/1/01\n6/3/06\n10\n5.3\n4.74\n47.40%\n200,000\n350,000\n42.86%\n$120,000\n$56,877\n$51,429\n159\n2001\n35' Flexible\n3/1/01\n6/3/06\n10\n5.3\n4.74\n47.40%\n300,000\n350,000\n14.29%\n$195,000\n$92,425\n$27,857\n160\n2001\n35' Flexible\n3/1/01\n11/2/07\n10\n6.7\n3.32\n33.23%\n300,000\n350,000\n14.29%\n$195,000\n$64,804\n$27,857\n161\n2001\n35' Flexible\n3/1/01\n7/2/07\n10\n6.3\n3.66\n36.60%\n325,000\n350,000\n7.14%\n$195,000\n$71,375\n$13,929\n163\n2001\n35' Flexible\n3/1/01\n11/2/07\n10\n6.7\n3.32\n33.23%\n325,000\n350,000\n7.14%\n$195,000\n$64,804\n$13,929\n164\n1996\n40' Buses\n3/21/96\n4/3/06\n12\n10\n1.96\n16.32%\n425,000\n500,000\n15.00%\n$295,000\n$48,156\n$44,250\n165\n1996\n40' Buses\n6/19/96\n4/3/07\n12\n10.8\n1.21\n10.05%\n435,000\n500,000\n13.00%\n$295,000\n$29,635\n$38,350\n166\n1996\n40' Buses\n6/19/96\n4/3/07\n12\n10.8\n1.21\n10.05%\n450,000\n500,000\n10.00%\n$295,000\n$29,635\n$29,500\n167\n1996\n40' Buses\n6/20/96\n6/2/07\n12\n11\n1.04\n8.70%\n450,000\n500,000\n10.00%\n$295,000\n$25,661\n$29,500\n168\n1996\n40' Buses\n6/23/96\n6/2/07\n12\n10.9\n1.05\n8.77%\n450,000\n500,000\n10.00%\n$295,000\n$25,863\n$29,500\nAPPENDIX F:   COST ALLOCATION PLANS\n1. GENERAL.  As authorized by 2 CFR \u00a7 200.27, FTA uses the term \u201ccost allocation plan\u201d (CAP) to mean central service cost allocation plan.  Central service cost allocation plan means the documentation identifying, accumulating, and allocating or developing billing rates based on the allowable costs of services provided by a state or local government, or Indian tribe, on a centralized basis to its departments and agencies, per 2 CFR \u00a7 200.9.  Most state and local governments, and Indian tribes provide certain services, such as motor pools, computer centers, purchasing, accounting, etc., to operating agencies on a centralized basis.  A central service cost allocation plan provides the process by which these central service costs can be identified and assigned to benefited activities on a reasonable and consistent basis.  All costs and other data used to distribute the costs included in the plan should be supported by formal accounting and other records that will support the propriety of the costs assigned to federal Award.\nThe central service cost allocation plan will include all central service costs that will be claimed (either as a billed or an allocated cost) under federal Award and will be documented as described in 2 CFR part 200, Appendix V, section E, \u201cDocumentation Requirements for Submitted Plans.\u201d1  Costs of central services omitted from the plan will not be reimbursed.  Following are the general requirements for CAPs:\n1 While centralized services cost allocation plans are not required for institutions of higher education (IHE) or nonprofit entities, 2 CFR part 200, Appendices III and IV, respectively, do require IHEs and nonprofit entities to allocate costs.\na. CAPs must be updated annually and made available for review at the state\u2019s or local government\u2019s single audit.\nb. CAPs must be approved in accordance with the requirements of the federal cognizant agency for indirect costs.\nc. Additionally, all costs in the plan must be supported by formal accounting records to substantiate the propriety of eventual charges.  Central service costs that are not included in the plan should not be reimbursed by federal Awards.  To the extent feasible, CAPS should be presented in a single document.\n2. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS.  All proposed central service allocation plans must be accompanied by the following:  a. An organization chart sufficiently detailed to show operations including the central service activities of the state, local government or Indian tribe, whether or not they are shown as benefitting from central service functions;\nb. A copy of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (or a copy of the Executive Budget if budgeted costs are being proposed) to support the allowable costs of each central service activity included in the plan;\nc. A certification of conformance which states that the plan was prepared in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, Appendix V, subsection E.4 and the federal Award(s) to which they apply.\nd. Unallowable costs have been adjusted as indicated in the cost allocation plan.\ne. The same costs that have been treated as indirect costs have not been claimed as direct costs.\nf. Federal Awards contain only allowable costs, and the plan was prepared in a manner that treated similar costs consistently among the various federal Awards and between federal and non-federal awards/activities.\ng. A proposal to establish a CAP will be unacceptable if the CAP Certificate is omitted.  The certificate must be signed on behalf of the governmental unit by an individual at a level no lower than chief financial officer of the governmental unit that submits the plan.  For details related to documentation requirements for allocated and billed central service costs refer to 2 CFR part 200, Appendix V, section E, \u201cDocumentation Requirements for Submitted Plans,\u201d numbers 2, 3, and 4, respectively.\n3. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.  The Cost Allocation Plan must be submitted to the recipient\u2019s Federal Cognizant Agency for indirect costs for approval based on the following:   a. Each state will submit its CAP to the Department of Health and Human Services each year.\nb. Each major local government (one which receives more than $100 million in direct federal Awards) is required to submit the CAP to its cognizant agency for indirect costs annually.\nc. All other local governments must prepare and retain CAPs for the Single Audit and submit CAPs only when required by the cognizant agency.\nd. When FTA is the cognizant agency, the CAP must be submitted under the following circumstances: (1) for an initial plan, (2) annually for major local governments, (3) for a change in organizational structure and accounting system that may significantly impact the CAP, (4) for a change in CAP methodology, and/or (5) upon request for all other entities.  All CAPs must be retained for audit.\nWhenever the cognizant agency gives approval to a government-wide CAP, such approval should be formalized, in a written agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the state, local government, or Indian tribe, and distributed to all interested federal agencies, and applicable to all federal Awards in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, Appendix V.  See information below.  (See 2 CFR part 200, Appendix VII for more detailed information on States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals.)\n2 CFR part 200, Appendix V, section D.  \u201cSubmission Requirements\u201d states:\n(1) Each state will submit a plan to the Department of Health and Human Services for each year in which it claims central service costs under federal Awards.  The plan should include (a) a projection of the next year\u2019s allocated central service cost (based either on actual costs for the most recently completed year or the budget projection for the coming year), and (b) a reconciliation of actual allocated central service costs to the estimated costs used for either the most recently completed year or the year immediately preceding the most recently completed year.\n(2) Each major local government is also required to submit a plan to its cognizant agency for indirect costs annually.\n(3) All other local governments claiming central service costs must develop a plan in accordance with the requirements described in this Part and maintain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit.  These local governments are not required to submit their plans for federal approval unless they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.  Where a local government only receives funds as a subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be responsible for monitoring the subrecipient\u2019s plan.\n(4) All central service cost allocation plans will be prepared by governmental units or agencies that receive over $35 million per year in direct Federal funding and, when required, submitted within six months after the close of each of the governmental unit\u2019s fiscal years in which it proposes to claim central service costs.  Extensions may be granted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs on a case-by-case basis.\n4. FTA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  Generally central service costs are included in the indirect cost pool(s) of the operating governmental departments or agencies.  Therefore, central service costs are generally included in the overall indirect cost information that is required in the FFR.\n5. FTA REVIEWS OF CAPS.  CAPs submitted to the FTA for approval are subject to review.  The purpose of a CAP proposal review is to ensure that the methodology and the rates proposed by the recipient meet the criteria contained in 2 CFR part 200 and FTA policies as a condition for reimbursement.\n6.

Indirect cost rate proposal means the documentation prepared by a recipient or subrecipient to substantiate its request for the establishment of an indirect cost rate.  Individual operating agencies (governmental department or agency) and non-profit recipients, normally charge federal Awards for indirect costs through an indirect cost rate.  A separate indirect cost rate(s) proposal for each operating agency is usually necessary to claim indirect costs under federal Awards.  Indirect costs include: (1) the indirect costs originating in each department or agency of the recipient carrying out federal Awards; and (2) the costs of central governmental services distributed through the central service cost allocation plan and not otherwise treated as direct costs (See Appendix F, Cost Allocation Plans).\nRecipients that intend to seek the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) reimbursement for indirect costs must prepare an Indirect Cost Rate Proposal (ICRP) unless the Recipient has never negotiated an indirect cost rate and chooses to use a de minimis rate of 10% of the modified total direct cost.  Also, recipients that already have an established indirect cost rate may apply for a 4-year extension of their current negotiated indirect cost rate for a maximum period of up to five years.  Note that only final or predetermined rates may be extended.  Any recipient who receives more than $35 million in direct federal funding must submit its indirect cost rate proposal to its cognizant agency for indirect costs.\nFor those recipients that do not choose to use the de minimis rate or receive approval of an extension of their current negotiated indirect cost rate, the following are basic requirements for an ICRP.\na. ICRPs must be updated annually.\nb. The updated ICRP must be retained and made available for review at the recipient\u2019s annual single audit.\nc. The initial ICRP must be approved by FTA or another cognizant federal agency.  The cognizant agency is the agency responsible for reviewing and approving the recipient\u2019s ICRP.  For subsequent approvals, please refer to section 3 of this appendix.\nAdditionally, all costs in the ICRP must be supported by formal accounting records to substantiate the propriety of eventual charges.  The ICRP of the recipient should cover all applicable costs.  It should also cover costs allocated under plans of other agencies or organizational units which are to be included in the costs of other federally sponsored programs.  To the extent feasible, ICRPs of all agencies rendering assistance to the recipient should be presented in a single document.\n2. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS.  Documentation requirements for an ICRP vary based on the type of organization.  See section 7 below for references to the requirements for\neach type of organization.  In general, the ICRP should contain, but need not be limited to, the following:  a. An Organization Chart.\nb. Financial Statements.\nc. ICRP Methodology \u2013 under 2 CFR part 200, Appendix VII - the recipient may use a simplified method or multiple allocation base method for completing the indirect cost rate proposal.  Generally, the simplified method is used where a recipient\u2019s major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately the same degree.  The simplified method results in one indirect cost rate for the entire recipient.  Conversely the multiple allocation base method is used where a recipient\u2019s major functions benefit from indirect costs to varying degrees.  The multiple allocation base method results in two or more rates related to each operating department or similar operating departments within the recipient.  The calculations of the rates depend on the type of organization, therefore refer to 2 CFR part 200 for details.\nd. Supporting Documentation:  (1) Identification of the costs included in the indirect cost pool(s),\n(2) Identification and description of the allocation base(s),\n(3) Identification of the amount, nature, and treatment of unallowable costs and excluded items,\n(4) Descriptions of the departments included in the organizational chart, including the nature of costs (direct, indirect, or combination),\n(5) Please refer to the appropriate appendix of 2 CFR part 200 for additional documentation requirements (See 8 below),\n(6) Proposal Reconciliation with Financial Statements (Note: Allocated costs must be reasonable and trackable to the financial Statements),\n(7) Identification of Federal Award Direct Cost Base (Note: Bases should be reasonable and trackable to the financial statements and supporting documents); and\n(8) Certification of Conformance with 2 CFR part 200.  A proposal to establish an Indirect Cost Rate Proposal will be unacceptable if the Certificate of Indirect Costs is omitted.  The certificate must be signed on behalf of the governmental unit by an individual at a level no lower than chief financial officer of the governmental unit that submits the proposal or component covered by the proposal.\n3. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.  2 CFR part 200, Appendix VII, section D, \u201cSubmission and Documentation of Proposals,\u201d - requires that each local governmental unit or agency that\nreceives more than $35 million in direct federal funding is required to submit a proposal to its cognizant agency for indirect costs within six months prior to the beginning of the recipient\u2019s fiscal year.  All other governmental units claiming indirect costs must develop a plan and maintain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit.  These local governments are not required to submit their plans for federal approval unless they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.\nNon-profit organizations are required to submit their ICRP to the cognizant agency within six months after the close of each fiscal year.\nInstitutions of higher education (IHE) should submit their indirect costs rate proposals to their cognizant agency (generally HHS or DoD).  The deadlines for submission of IHE ICRPs are determined by the cognizant agency.\nWhen a subrecipient only receives federal funds as a subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be responsible for reviewing, approving, negotiating, and monitoring the subrecipient\u2019s ICRP.\nWhen FTA is the cognizant agency for indirect costs, the ICRP should be submitted to the FTA when:\na. The recipient is working on its first federal assistance Award or has not previously had an Indirect Cost Rate Proposal reviewed and accepted (note that such recipients may be eligible for the de minimis rate described in section 1 above).\nb. The recipient has made a change in its accounting system that significantly impacts the previously approved Indirect Cost Rate Proposal and its basis of application.\nc. The recipient\u2019s proposed Indirect Cost Rate Proposal exceeds the rate(s) last approved by FTA by more than 20 percent.\nFor example, if FTA approved a 20 percent rate in 2013, and the rate increased to 23 percent in 2014, and again to 25 percent in 2015, the 2015 rate would be required to be submitted to FTA for approval as it increased by more than 20 percent.\nd. The recipient changes the Indirect Cost Rate Proposal methodology.\ne. The recipient is either a local governmental unit that receives more than $35 million in direct federal funding or a non-profit entity.  In accordance with 2 CFR part 200, these entities must submit their plan annually to their cognizant agency.\nThe FTA may allow the recipient to use a provisional rate for initial submissions and required resubmissions pending completion of the review/negotiation.  After the rate is approved, that rate and subsequent rates should be applied as fixed rates until a resubmission is required.  Fixed rate means an indirect cost rate that is applicable to a specified current or future period, usually the governmental unit\u2019s fiscal year.  This rate is based on an estimate of the costs to be incurred during the period and the difference between the estimated costs\nand the actual allowable costs of the period covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent period.\nUnder unique circumstances, on a case by case basis, the FTA will approve a predetermined rate.  For definitions of provisional rates, final rates, fixed rates, and predetermined rates please refer to 2 CFR part 200, Appendix VII, section B, \u201cDefinitions\u201d.\n4. FTA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  Award Budgets should clearly identify proposed indirect costs that are budgeted separately or are part of an activity line item (ALI).  Either documentation of the approved indirect cost rate or a statement that the recipient\u2019s rate needs to be approved by its cognizant agency should be submitted with an application for federal assistance.\nAfter the Award, recipients that have approved indirect cost rate proposals should include indirect cost information in the Federal Financial Report (FFR).  Indirect costs should be included in total expenditures.  Also, the FFR should include the indirect expense type, the rate approved by the cognizant agency, the total base amount on which the indirect cost rate is determined, the period covered by the approved rate, the total amount of indirect expenses charged to the Award on a cumulative basis, and the federal share of the indirect expenses charged.  Recipients that do not have approved indirect cost rate proposals should not charge indirect costs to FTA Awards.  See FFR instructions for entering data for single simplified rates or multiple rates.\n5. FTA REVIEWS OF INDIRECT COST RATE PROPOSALS.  ICRPs submitted to the FTA for approval are subject to review.  The purpose of an indirect cost rate proposal review is to ensure that the methodology and the rates proposed by the recipient meet the criteria contained in 2 CFR part 200 and FTA ", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "7ac3f2b8-94ef-4a6c-aca6-dafc99c1e14f"}, "2879000266742239794": {"text": "policies as a condition for reimbursement.\n6. ICRP APPROVAL.  Whenever the cognizant agency gives approval to an Indirect Cost Rate Proposal, such approval is formalized, distributed to all interested federal agencies, and applicable to all federal Awards in accordance with 2 CFR part 200.\n7.

All official Frequently Asked Questions and updates to 2 CFR part 200.\nAPPENDIX H:   REQUEST FOR ADVANCE OR REIMBURSEMENT (SF\u2013270)\n1. GENERAL.  Recipients that receive federal assistance through cooperative agreements, and any recipients that receive funds through Grant or Cooperative Agreements (or Other Agreements) that are not permitted to receive payment or reimbursement via ECHO, agree as follows:  a. New recipients must first provide financial information to enroll in the automated clearinghouse (ACH) system.  Assistance will be provided by the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA\u2019s) Enterprise Service Center (ESC) and the administering office.\nb. Recipient must complete and attach an original Standard Form 270, \u201cRequest for Advance or Reimbursement\u201d (See Sample Request for Advance or Reimbursement Form [SF\u2013270] Exhibit 2 of this appendix) with supporting documentation when submitting request for reimbursement via DELPHI e-Invoicing System or DELPHI Markview system.  Upon receipt of the SF-270 payment request and supporting documentation, ESC will disburse payments by ACH deposit for all requests approved by the authorized FTA Project Manager in the DELPHI e-Invoicing System or DELPHI Markview system.\nc. Recipients may also complete and submit an original SF-270 to ESC at:\nFAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center  Library, AMA\u2013300A 6500 S.  MacArthur Blvd. Oklahoma City, OK 73169\nHowever, the preferred method of submission is electronically through the DELPHI e-Invoicing systems listed above.\n2. INSTRUCTIONS.  Instructions for completing an SF-270 (Exhibit 2) are printed on its reverse side.  In addition, the following instructions should assist recipients in completing this form:  a. Only the total column on this form should be completed, unless the project involves more than one funding ratio.  In such instances, the other columns are also to be used.\nIn addition, recipients should round all figures to the nearest dollar; that is, amounts of $0.50 or over would be rounded to the higher dollar.  For example: if the other than federal share is computed to be $2,572.70, the amount reported would be $2,573.\nb. Block #5\u2014All requisitions should be numbered consecutively beginning with #1 as the first requisition.  Suggested format should include the fiscal year and sequential number for each individual voucher.  For example, the payment request number for the\nrecipient\u2019s first voucher submitted in FY 2016 would appear on the SF-270 as follows: 2016\u2013001.\nc. Block #8\u2014The first requisition covers the date the federal assistance was awarded (unless the project had pre-award authority, through the end of the period for which reimbursement is requested).  When a requisition requests reimbursement only, the \u201cending\u201d date will be the same date on which outlays are reported on line 11a of this form.  If the reimbursement and/or an advance is being requested, the \u201cending\u201d date should reflect the period through which the advance is needed.\nAll requisition report periods should run consecutively.  For example, if a requisition is submitted for the period 1/1/16 to 3/31/16, the next requisition will begin 4/1/16.\nd. Block #9\u2014The name of the recipient should be exactly as indicated on the Grant Agreement, Cooperative Agreement, or Other Agreement.  Recipients should avoid abbreviation and spell out the entire name of the organization.\ne. Block #11\u2014Line A\u2014The \u201cas of\u201d date should be the date for which the recipient has actual costs recorded.  This date should be the same as the \u201cto\u201d date, Block #8, unless the recipient is requesting an advance.   (1) Line B\u2014Represents the amount applicable to program income that was required to be used for the project or program by terms of the Grant Agreement, Cooperative Agreement, or Other Agreement.\n(2) Line D\u2014Represents the estimated expenditures for the advance period, both the FTA share and the non-federal share.\n(3) Line F\u2014The non-federal share of line E, depending on the funding ratio of a particular project.\n(4) Line G\u2014The federal share of line E, depending on the funding ratio for a particular project.\n(5) Line H\u2014The total of previous requisition(s) submitted.  This line should not represent actual payment received because the recipient may have submitted a requisition that is in the process of being paid.  Requisition #1 on this line should be zero.\nNote that the recipient should complete only the \u201ctotal\u201d column of Block #11, unless the Grant Agreement, Cooperative Agreement, or Other Agreement specified that there is more than one funding source supporting the project.  In such cases, separate columns should be utilized for each funding source.\n(6) Line I\u2014The federal share now requested represents the total amount of the SF-270 reimbursement that will be forwarded to the recipient.\n3. REVIEW OF THE SF-270.  Each SF-270 for federal assistance will be reviewed in light of the periodic milestone progress reports (MPRs) and financial reports required for each project.  Changes requiring amendments to the Grant Agreement, Cooperative Agreement, or Other Agreement or prior approval of a revision to the Award Budget must be approved before federal assistance for these changes are requisitioned.\nExhibit 1: ACH Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment Form (SF3881)\n\nInstructions for Completing SF 3881 Form\n\nExhibit 2: Request for Advance or Reimbursement (SF-270)\n\nInstructions for Completing SF-270 Form\nAPPENDIX I:   REPORTING ON REAL PROPERTY INVENTORY\nGENERAL.

THE FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION (FTA).  FTA is one of ten operating administrations within the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).  Headed by an administrator appointed by the President of the United States, FTA functions through a Washington, DC, headquarters office, 10 regional offices, and 6 metropolitan offices that assist transit agencies in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa and federally recognized Indian tribes.\nAs defined in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5302, \u201cpublic transportation,\u201d means regular, continuing shared-ride surface transportation services that are open to the general public or open to a segment of the general public defined by age, disability, or low income.  Public transportation generally includes, but is not limited to, transportation services provided by buses, heavy rail, light rail, commuter rail, fixed guideway, bus rapid transit, passenger ferryboats, trolleys, inclined railways, people movers, vans, streetcars, jitneys, and aerial tramways.  Public transportation can be either fixed-route or demand-response service, but excludes intercity passenger rail provided by Amtrak, intercity bus service, charter bus service, school bus service, sightseeing services, courtesy shuttle services provided by individual businesses and intra-terminal or intra-facility shuttle services.  The terms \u201ctransit\u201d and \u201cmass transportation\u201d are used interchangeably with \u201cpublic transportation.\u201d\nThe Federal Government, through FTA, provides financial assistance to develop new transit systems and improve, maintain, and operate existing systems.  FTA oversees thousands of Awards with hundreds of state and local transit providers, primarily through its ten regional offices.  Recipients and subrecipients of federal assistance for these projects are responsible for managing their programs in accordance with federal requirements.  FTA is responsible for ensuring that recipients and subrecipients follow federal statutory and administrative requirements. FTA is also authorized to establish national standards and requirements, to conduct necessary safety oversight, and to issue directives to ensure the safety of the nation\u2019s public transportation systems.\n2. AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION AND GUIDANCE.  Most federal transit laws are codified in 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.  Authorizing legislation is substantive legislation enacted by Congress that establishes or continues the legal operation of a federal program or agency.  Congress typically amends FTA\u2019s authorizing legislation every four to six years.  FTA\u2019s most recent authorizing legislation is the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act programs, Public Law 114-94, signed into law on December 4, 2015, with an effective date of October 1, 2015.\nThe Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) authorized FTA programs for FY 2013 through FY 2015, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) authorized FTA programs from FY 2005 through FY 2012.  Changes have been added to this circular to reflect FAST and MAP-21 changes to federal transit law and changes required by other laws that have become effective since the circular was last published in 2012.\nThe circular revision also incorporates provisions of the Office of Management and Budget, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d (referred to as the Uniform Guidance), 2 CFR part 200.  The Uniform Guidance, 2 CFR part 200, supersedes and streamlines the administrative and cost principles provisions of requirements from former OMB Circulars A-21, A-87, A-102, A-110, and A-122, administrative requirements.  The Uniform Guidance also supersedes former OMB Circulars A-89, pertaining to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, and former OMB Circulars A-133, which addressed the Single Audit Act, and A-50, which addressed Single Audit Act follow-up.\nU.S. DOT regulations, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d 2 CFR part 1201, supersedes and replaces the requirements of the DOT Common Rule, former 49 CFR parts 18 and 19, except that former 49 CFR parts 18 and 19 will continue to apply to Grant and Cooperative Agreements awarded before December 26, 2014, as in effect on the date of such Grant or Cooperative Agreements (See information below for further clarity).\nThe final guidance consolidates the guidance previously contained in the aforementioned regulations and circulars into a streamlined format that aims to improve both the clarity and accessibility.  DOT\u2019s Common Rule, 2 CFR part 1201, incorporates the OMB Uniform Guidance by reference and makes that guidance part of the DOT regulation.  The OMB final Uniform Guidance is located in 2 CFR, part 200.  Copies of 2 CFR part 200 and the former OMB Circulars that are superseded by this guidance are available on OMB\u2019s Web site at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_default.\n3. HOW TO CONTACT FTA.  FTA\u2019s regional and metropolitan offices are responsible for the provision of financial assistance to FTA recipients and subrecipients and oversight of project implementation for most FTA programs.  Certain programs are the responsibility of FTA Headquarters.  Inquiries should be directed to either the regional or metropolitan office responsible for the geographic area in which you are located.  See Appendix K of this circular for additional information.\nVisit the FTA Web site (www.transit.dot.gov) or contact FTA Headquarters at the following address and phone number:\nFederal Transit Administration\nOffice of Communication and Congressional Affairs\n1200 New Jersey Avenue SE.\nRoom E56\u2013205\nWashington, DC 20590\nPhone: 202-366-4043\nFax: 202-366-3472\n4. GRANTS.GOV.  FTA posts all competitive federal assistance opportunities on Grants.gov.  Grants.gov is the one Web site for information on all discretionary federal assistance agreement opportunities.  More information about Grants.gov is available at www.grants.gov.\n5. DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS.  All definitions in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5302 and 2 CFR part 200, subpart A apply to this circular, as well as the following definitions and acronyms: a. Definitions. (1) Accrual Basis of Accounting: The accrual basis of accounting means the accounting method in which income is recorded when earned instead of when received, and expenses are recorded when incurred instead of when paid.\n(2) Acquisition Cost: Acquisition cost means the cost of the asset including the cost to prepare the asset for its intended use.  The acquisition cost for equipment, for example, means the net invoice price of the equipment, including the cost of any modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make it usable for the purpose for which it is acquired.  Acquisition costs for software include those development costs capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  Ot", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "94f8f600-d3a2-4798-bc35-d32f38def3ab"}, "3792350125487700248": {"text": "her charges such as the cost of inspection, installation, transportation, taxes, duty or protective in-transit insurance should be treated in accordance with the applicant or recipient\u2019s regular accounting practices, as separate line items.  The cost of items separately installed and removable from rolling stock, such as fareboxes and radios, is treated as a separate acquisition and not as part of the cost of the vehicle if not included in the procurement of rolling stock.\n(3) Activity Line Item (ALI): Activity Line Item means the detailed description narrative and dollar amount to more fully explain the scope of work of that activity.  Every ALI is associated with a specific Scope Code; the relationship between scope codes and ALIs is outlined in FTA\u2019s \u201cALI Tree.\u201d A sufficient level of information must be provided for each ALI for FTA and the recipient to manage activities approved as part of the Award.\n(4) Administrative Amendment: Administrative amendment means a minor change to an Award initiated by FTA to modify or clarify certain terms, conditions, or provisions of a Grant or Cooperative Agreement.\n(5) Administrative Settlement: Administrative settlement means a settlement in which: (1) the purchase price for property may exceed the amount offered as just compensation when reasonable efforts to negotiate an agreement at that amount have failed, and (2) an authorized federal agency official approves such an arrangement.  The arrangement must be reasonable, prudent, and in the public interest.\n(6) Advance Payment: Advance payment means a payment that a federal awarding agency or pass-through entity makes by any appropriate payment mechanism, including a predetermined payment schedule, before the recipient or subrecipient disburses the funds for program purposes.\n(7) Air Rights:  Air rights mean the space located above the surface of the ground, lying within a project\u2019s property limits.\n(8) Allocation: Allocation means the process of assigning a cost, or a group of costs, to one or more cost objectives, in reasonable proportion to the benefit provided or other equitable relationship.  The process may entail assigning one or more costs directly to a final cost objective or through one or more intermediate cost objectives.\n(9) Amendment: Amendment means the modification of a Grant or Cooperative Agreement that includes a change in scope of work and/or change in federal assistance, as approved by FTA.\n(10) Applicant: In this circular, the term \u201capplicant\u201d is used to identify an entity that is seeking, but has not yet been awarded, specific federal assistance directly from FTA in the form of a Grant or Cooperative Agreement.\n(11) Application: An application means a complete application submitted to FTA for an Award of federal assistance to an eligible recipient in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the Federal Government through a Grant or Cooperative Agreement.\n(12) Associated Transit Improvement: An associated transit improvement (formerly referred to as \u201cTransit Enhancements\u201d) means, with respect to any project or an area to be served by a project, projects that are designed to enhance public transportation service or use and that are physically or functionally related to transit facilities.  Eligible projects are: (1) historic preservation, rehabilitation, and operation of historic public transportation buildings, structures, and facilities (including historic bus and railroad facilities) intended for use in public transportation service; (2) bus shelters; (3) functional landscaping that serves a purpose other than aesthetic, including, but not limited to : erosion control; storm water drainage; mitigating the effects of weather on passengers, including the provision of shade and windscreen; (4) streetscaping, including benches, trash receptacles, and streetlights; (5) pedestrian access and walkways; (6) bicycle access, including bicycle storage shelters and parking facilities and the installation of equipment for transporting bicycles on public transportation vehicles; (7) signage; or (8) enhanced access for persons with disabilities to public transportation.  The FAST Act prohibits grants or loans to be used to pay incremental costs of incorporating art or non-functional landscaping into facilities, including the cost of an artist on the design team.\nLandscaping can be used to aid in the absorption or drainage of rainwater, prevention of erosion, support of structures on a steep grade, minimization of noise impacts, protection of habitat, provision of shade in hot climates, channeling of pedestrian or vehicle traffic, definition of useable or unsafe spaces, and many other purposes.  In interpreting the term \u201cfunctional landscaping\u201d under this provision of law, FTA draws a similar distinction, as with art, between functionally appropriate landscape design and landscape elements installed primarily for visual or aesthetic appeal.\nFor example, an eligible landscaping expense would include the installation of shade trees near a passenger station entrance.  Likewise, FTA would allow the use of grant funds to install dense shrubs surrounding the area containing the transit system\u2019s electrical equipment.  FTA would expect the grantee to select particular varieties of trees and shrubs that are well suited for the particular location and climate.\n(13) Audit Finding: Audit finding means the deficiencies that the auditor is required to report in the schedule of findings and questioned costs as required by 2 CFR \u00a7 200.516(a).\n(14) Auditee: Auditee means any recipient or subrecipient that expends federal assistance that must be audited as required under 2 CFR \u00a7 200, subpart F.\n(15) Auditor: Auditor means a public accountant or a federal, state or local government or Indian tribe audit organization that meets the general standards specified in Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS); as required for the purpose of conducting Single Audits, (See 2 CFR \u00a7 200.7).  The term auditor does not include internal auditors of nonprofit organizations.  Auditor may also mean an individual that performs other non-financial audits, as deemed necessary by FTA.\n(16) Award: Award means the federal assistance FTA has provided to the Recipient to carry out the Scope of Work that FTA has approved.  The Award also includes the requirements of all documents, terms, and conditions incorporated by reference and made part of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.\n(17) Award Budget: Award Budget means the budget for all the Projects encompassed by the FTA Award.  It may include the federal and non-federal share or only the federal share, as determined by FTA or a pass-through entity.\n(18) Brownfields: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines \u201cbrownfields\u201d as real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.  These properties have lower levels of contamination than Superfund sites, but they are still a health risk and economic detriment to the communities where they are located.\n(19) Budget Revision: Budget revision means any change of budget allocations within the Award and the overall Award Budget that has minor impact on the budget allocations of the original Grant or Cooperative Agreement.   (20) Capital Asset: Capital asset means a unit of rolling stock, land, a facility, a unit of equipment, an element of infrastructure, or intellectual property (including software), with a useful life of more than one year that are capitalized in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  Capital asset also includes an addition, improvement, modification, replacement, rearrangement, reinstallation, renovation, or alterations to capital assets that materially increase the value of the asset (apart from ordinary repairs and maintenance.)\n(21) Capital Expenditures: Capital expenditures means expenditures to acquire capital assets or expenditures to make additions, improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements, reinstallations, renovations, or alterations to capital assets that materially increase their value or useful life.\n(22) Capital Lease: Capital lease means any transaction in which the recipient acquires the right to use a capital asset without obtaining full ownership, regardless of the tax status of the transaction.  For purposes of section 3019 of the FAST Act, however, capital lease means any agreement under which a recipient acquires the right to use rolling stock or related equipment for a specified period of time, in exchange for a periodic payment.\n(23) Capital Project: Capital project means a category of reimbursable projects that includes all activities identified in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5302(3).\n(24) Cash Basis of Accounting: The cash basis of accounting is the method in which revenue is recorded when received, rather than when earned, and expenses are recorded when paid, rather than when incurred.  FTA does not permit recipients to prepare their Federal Financial Reports (FFR) using the cash method of accounting.\n(25) Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance: The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) is a Government-wide compendium of federal programs, projects, services, and activities that provide assistance or benefits to the American public.  It contains financial and nonfinancial assistance programs administered by departments and establishments of the Federal Government.  The CFDA number assigned to each program is used to report and track audit findings related to federal Grants and Cooperative Agreements.\n(26) Claim: Claim means, depending on the context, either: (1) a written demand or written assertion by one of the parties to a federal Award seeking as a matter of right: (a) the payment of money in a sum certain, (b) the adjustment or interpretation of the terms and conditions of the federal Award, or (c) other relief arising under or rel", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "43581c0d-1355-4bfc-9ae3-408953556d13"}, "4180486622821465724": {"text": "ating to a federal Award; or (2) a request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted.\n(27) Closeout: Closeout means the process by which FTA, or pass-through entity, determines that the scope of work of the federal Award and all applicable administrative actions, including actions described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.343, have been met or FTA has determined the Award should be terminated.   (28) Cluster of Programs: A cluster of programs means a grouping of closely-related programs that share common compliance requirements.  A cluster of programs must be considered as one program for determining major programs, as described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.518 and, with the exception of Research and Development, as described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.501(c), to determine whether a program-specific audit may be elected.\n(29) Cognizant Agency for Audit: The cognizant agency for audit is the federal agency designated to carry out the responsibilities described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.513(a).  The cognizant agency for audit is not necessarily the same as the cognizant agency for indirect costs.  A list of cognizant agencies for audit may be found at the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) Web site.\n(30) Cognizant Agency for Indirect Costs: The cognizant agency for indirect costs is the federal agency responsible for reviewing, negotiating, and approving cost allocation plans, or indirect cost proposals, developed on behalf of all federal agencies.  The cognizant agency for indirect costs is not necessarily the same as the cognizant agency for audit.

In this circular FTA uses the term \u201cgrantee\u201d interchangeably with \u201crecipient,\u201d \u201cgrant recipient,\u201d and \u201cdirect recipient.\u201d\n(74) Idle Capacity: Idle capacity means the unused capacity of partially used facilities.  Idle capacity is the difference between that which a facility could achieve under 100 percent operating time, on a one-shift basis, less operating interruptions resulting from time lost for repairs, setups, unsatisfactory materials, and other normal delays and the extent to which the facility was actually used to meet demands during the accounting period.\n(75) Idle Facility: Idle facility means completely unused facilities that are excess to the recipient\u2019s current needs.\n(76) Incidental Use: Incidental use means the limited authorized non-transit use of project property acquired with FTA assistance.  Such use must not conflict with the approved ", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "871aca87-7742-498b-9bc6-5a66a1799809"}, "8391560990776810427": {"text": "purposes of the project and must not interfere with the intended transit uses of the project property.

First, once an acquisition case is referred to legal counsel to initiate condemnation proceedings, a settlement between the parties may occur before a condemnation complaint is filed.  The second situation, involves the settlement of a case after the condemnation action has been filed.  This may be referred to as a legal or stipulated settlement.  In this case a stipulation agreement is prepared and signed by the parties involved after which the court may approve or issue an order approving the stipulation agreement and dismissing the court case.  In either case such a settlement would necessarily be justified in writing similarly to an administrative settlement as described in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(i) of the URA regulations.

The Act established the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and established national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of the environment; and provides a process for implementing these goals within the federal agencies.  While many different federal laws, rules, and regulations govern environmental review of federal actions, NEPA established an umbrella process for coordinating environmental compliance.  Therefore, NEPA is the primary law governing the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s (FTA) environmental protection process, as implemented through the FHWA/FTA joint regulations found at 23 CFR part 771 and 49 CFR part 622.\n(98) Net Present Value: Net present value means the discounted monetized value of expected net benefits (i.e., benefits minus costs).

Real property is land and anything permanently affixed to the land, such as buildings, fences, and those things attached to the buildings that, if removed, would deface the structure or integrality of the building, such as plumbing, heating fixtures, etc.  Personal property, on the other hand, is property of a temporary or moveable nature, and is not real property.  State law varies on the definition of real property and personal property.  Therefore, the recipient should rely on its state laws pertaining to real property and personal property.\n(129) Rebuild: Rebuild means a capital activity associated with rolling stock that occurs at, or near, the end of a unit of rolling stock\u2019s useful life, and that results in an extended useful life for the unit of rolling stock consistent with the extent of the rebuilding.\n(130) Recipient: Recipient means an entity that is awarded funds directly from FTA to carry out an activity under a federal program.  For purpose of this circular, a recipient can be a grant recipient, grantee, or a direct recipient, but can also be a recipient of federal assistance through a cooperative agreement.  The term recipient does not include subrecipient.\n(131) Remaining Federal Interest for Dispositions Before the End of the Useful Life of Project Property: Remaining federal interest for dispositions before the end of the useful life of project property means the amount calculated by multiplying the current fair market value or proceeds from the sale by FTA\u2019s share of the property.  Fair market value means the most probable price project property would bring in a competitive and open market.\n(132) Remaining Federal Interest in Federally-Assisted Property: Remaining federal interest in real property means the federal share of the fair market value of that property, the straight line depreciated value of improvements thereof, or the federal share of the current appraised land value, whichever is greater.

GENERAL.  This circular provides requirements and procedures for management of all applicable Federal Transit Administration (FTA) programs authorized under 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.\nFTA implements DOT regulations, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d 2 CFR part 1201, which incorporates by reference U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d 2 CFR part 200, for Awards made on and after December 26, 2014, and former 49 CFR parts 18 and 19 for Awards made before December 26, 2014.  Both 2 CFR part 1201 and former 49 CFR part 18 have specific provisions for certain state control of the administration of equipment, procurement, and financial management.  State requirements apply to those programs that have states as recipients, including 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5305, 5310, 5311, former Section 5316, and former Section 5317.  These state requirements also apply to States that receive federal assistance under other FTA programs for which both state and non-state entities are eligible.\n2. APPLICABLE PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS.  FTA provides formula and discretionary funding under a variety of programs by awarding federal assistance to eligible recipients through a Grant Agreement or Cooperative Agreement.  While this circular contains the post-award guidance for all applicable FTA programs, several of the programs described below have individual program circulars that contain pre-award instructions, project management guidance, and unique administrative requirements that apply to the Award.  Additionally, recipients of funding under the Public Transportation Innovation Program (Sections 5312) and the Technical Assistance and Workforce Development Program (Section 5314) should reference the most current edition of FTA Circular 6100 \u201cResearch, Technical Assistance and Training Program: Application Instructions and Program Management Guidelines\u201d rather than this Circular.\nIf there is a conflict between FTA Circular 5010.1 and program specific circulars, program specific circulars should prevail.  Please reference FTA\u2019s public Web site at www.fta.dot.gov for a complete listing of FTA programs and their current FTA circulars.\nNew and Revised Programs Under MAP-21 or the FAST Act:\na. Metropolitan Planning and Statewide Planning and Research Programs (Section 5305(d) and (e) to implement Section 5303 and Section 5304).\nThese programs provide federal assistance to support cooperative, continuous, and comprehensive planning for making transportation investment decisions in metropolitan areas and statewide.\nFor planning activities that:\n(1) Support the economic vitality of the metropolitan area, especially by enabling global competitiveness, productivity, and efficiency;\n(2) Increase the safety of the transportation system for motorized and nonmotorized users;\n(3) Increase the security of the transportation system for motorized and nonmotorized users;\n(4) Increase the accessibility and mobility of people and freight;\n(5) Protect and enhance the environment, promote energy conservation, improve the quality of life, and promote consistency between transportation improvements and state and local planned growth and economic development patterns;\n(6) Enhance the integration and connectivity of the transportation system, across and between modes, for people and freight;\n(7) Promote efficient system management and operation;\n(8) Emphasize the preservation of the existing transportation system; and\n(9) Improve the resiliency and reliability of the transportation system.\nFederal assistance is apportioned annually by a formula to states that include consideration of each state\u2019s urbanized area population in proportion to the urbanized area population for the entire nation as well as other factors.  States receive no less than 0.5 percent of the amount apportioned.  These funds are sub-allocated by states to Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) by a formula that considers each MPO\u2019s urbanized area population, their individual planning needs, and a minimum distribution.  For more information, please refer to the Joint Planning Regulations at 49 CFR part 613 and the most recent edition of FTA Circular 8100.1.  To be eligible for federal assistance under these programs, projects and related activities must be proposed through the applicable transportation planning process.\nb. Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307), including a Passenger Ferry Grant Program (Section 5307(h)).\nThe Urbanized Area Formula Program makes federal resources available to urbanized areas for transit planning, capital, and operating assistance in urbanized areas.  An urbanized area is an area encompassing a population of not less than 50,000 people that has been defined and designated in the most recent decennial census as an \u201curbanized area\u201d by the Secretary of Commerce.\nFor urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more (as determined by the Bureau of the Census), federal assistance for the Urbanized Area Formula Program is\napportioned and flows directly to a designated recipient(s) selected by the governor, responsible local officials, and publicly owned operators of public transportation to receive and apportion urbanized area formula assistance.  For urbanized areas under 200,000 in population, the funds are apportioned to the governor of each state for distribution, unless such an area has been designated as a transportation management area at the request of the governor and the MPO.  These areas also receive apportionments directly.  Guidance for Section 5307 is found in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9030.1.  To be eligible for Awards under this program, projects and related activities must be proposed through the applicable transportation planning process and contained in a local Transportation Improvement Plan and State Transportation Improvement Plan.  A competitive Passenger Ferry Grant Program is also established under Section 5307(h).\nAdditional information about the Urbanized Area Formula Program, including the Passenger Ferry Grant Program is available in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9030.1.\nc. Fixed Guideway Capital Investment Program \u2013 New and Small Starts and Core Capacity Improvements (Section 5309).\nThe Fixed Guideway Capital Investment Grants Program is a discretionary grant program that finances the construction of new fixed guideway systems or extensions to existing fixed guideway systems, corridor-based BRT projects, and, as amended by MAP-21 and the FAST Act, projects that will expand the capacity of existing fixed guideway corridors that are at capacity or will be in five years.  States and local governmental authorities are eligible applicants for federal assistance under Section 5309.\nProjects become candidates for Awards under this program by successfully completing steps in the process defined in Section 5309 and obtaining a satisfactory rating under the statutorily defined criteria.  For New Starts and Core Capacity Improvement projects, the steps in the process include project development, engineering, and construction.  For Small Starts projects, the steps in the process include project development and construction.  New Starts and Core Capacity Improvement projects receive construction funds from the program through a full funding grant agreement (FFGA) that defines the scope of work of the project and specifies the total multiyear federal commitment to the project.  Small Starts projects receive construction funds through a single year Grant or an expedited Small Starts Grant Agreement that defines the scope of work of the project and specifies the federal commitment to the project.\nAdditional information about the Fixed Guideway Capital Investment Program is available on FTA\u2019s Web site in Capital Investment Grant Program Interim Policy Guidance, published in June 2016, and in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9300.1.\nd. Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities Formula Program (Section 5310).\nThe goal of the Section 5310 program is to improve mobility for seniors and individuals with disabilities throughout the country by removing barriers to transportation services\nand expanding the transportation mobility options available.  Toward this goal, FTA provides financial assistance for transportation services planned, designed, and carried out to meet the special transportation needs of seniors and individuals with disabilities in all areas\u2014large urbanized, small urbanized, and rural.  The program requires coordination with other federally assisted programs and services in order to make the most efficient use of federal resources.\nGuidance on the Section 5310 program is contained in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9070.1, \u201cEnhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities Program Guidance and Application Instructions.\u201d\ne. Rural Areas Formula Program (Section 5311).\nThe Rural Areas Formula Program is a formula grant program that provides capital, planning, and operating assistance to states and Indian tribes to support public transportation in rural areas with populations of less than 50,000, where many residents often rely on public transportation to reach their destinations.  FTA apportions funds under this program to the governor or the governor\u2019s designee.

Tribal Transit Program.\nThe Tribal Transit Program includes a $30 million formula program and continues a $5 million competitive program.  Formula factors include vehicle revenue miles and the number of low-income individuals residing on tribal lands.  Discretionary funds are allocated based on criteria established for the program.  Eligible direct recipients are federally recognized Indian tribes in rural areas.  The funds are to be allocated for grants to Indian tribes for any purpose eligible under Section 5311, which includes capital, operating, planning, job access and reverse commute projects, and administrative assistance for rural public transportation services and rural intercity bus service.\ng. Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Formula Program.\nThis program is financed from amounts made available to carry out Section 5311 and provides formula funds to support public transportation for states in the Appalachian region.  Federal assistance is allocated for any purpose eligible under Section 5311.  Additional information on the Section 5311 Rural Area Formula Program is available in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9040.1.\nh. Bus Testing Facility Program (Section 5318).\nSubsections 5318(a) \u2013 (d) authorizing the Bus Testing Facility remain in effect under the FAST Act.  Section 5318 continues support for the Bus Testing Facility for: (1) testing of new bus models, (2) operating and maintaining the facility, (3) collecting fees for the\ntesting of vehicles, and (4) paying for testing new bus models (which include older bus models that have been produced with a major change in configuration or components) for maintainability, reliability, safety, performance (including braking performance), structural integrity, fuel economy, emissions, and noise performance characteristics.\nMAP-21 expanded subsection 5318(e), Acquiring New Bus Models to include: (1) General requirements, and (2) bus test \u201cpass/fail\u201d standard requirements.\nNew bus models must now meet performance standards listed in subsection 5318(e) and meet performance standards established by DOT under the new safety authority in subsection 5329(b).  Subsection 5318(e) also requires that DOT issue, by rulemaking, a pass/fail bus testing standard.  Only bus models that receive a passing score may be purchased with 49 U.S.C. chapter 53 funds.  Under the rulemaking, a passing score is not to be interpreted as a warranty or guarantee to bus purchasers that the new bus model will meet their specific requirements.\ni. Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program (Section 5324).\nMAP-21 authorized the Section 5324 Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program (ER program).  The ER program authorizes FTA to make grants to public transportation agencies that have experienced serious damage to transit assets as a result of an emergency.  Emergency is defined as a natural disaster that affects a wide area, such as a flood, hurricane, tidal wave, earthquake, severe storm, or landslide, or a catastrophic failure from an external cause, as a result of which the governor of a state has declared an emergency and the Secretary of Transportation has concurred, or the President of the United States has declared a major disaster.\nFTA may make grants under the ER program for capital projects to protect, repair, reconstruct, or replace equipment and facilities of a public transportation system that the Secretary determines are in danger of suffering serious damage or have suffered serious damage as a result of a declared emergency.  In addition, FTA may reimburse operating expenses that are outside the scope of work of an affected recipient\u2019s normal operations, including but not limited to evacuations, rescue operations, bus, ferry, or rail service to replace inoperable service or to detour around damaged areas, temporary service to accommodate an influx of passengers or evacuees, returning evacuees to their homes after the disaster or emergency, and the net project costs related to reestablishing, expanding, or relocating public transportation service before, during, or after an emergency or major disaster.\nGrants under this program, or those made under Sections 5307 or 5311 to address a declared emergency are subject to the terms and conditions that FTA determines are necessary.  FTA will not provide federal assistance for any expenses that are reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\nThe ER program is implemented by regulation under 49 CFR part 602, \u201cEmergency Relief.\u201d Guidance on the ER program is found in the most current version of the FTA Emergency Relief Manual.\nj. Public Transportation Safety Program (Section 5329).\nThe Public Transportation Safety Program, Section 5329, requires DOT to create and implement a national safety plan for all public transportation system recipients of 49 U.S.C. chapter 53 funds.  In this section, \u201crecipient\u201d means a state or local governmental authority, or any other operator of a public transportation system, that receives financial assistance under 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.\nThis section defines the content of the National Public Transportation Safety Plan, establishes a DOT transit safety certification training program, and requires public transit agencies to establish a comprehensive agency safety plan that identifies and seeks to minimize risk, sets safety performance and state of good repair targets, and includes a comprehensive training program.\nSection 5329 also establishes the State Safety Oversight (SSO) program for states operating rail transit systems other than commuter rail.  This subsection grants states three years to establish an approved SSO program with adequately trained staff to oversee rail fixed guideway safety, and to establish a State Safety Oversight Agency.  The legislation also requires that SSO agencies be empowered with oversight, investigative, auditing, and enforcement authority, and be independently funded, i.e., transit agencies are prohibited from funding the SSO agency; funds must be derived from an independent agency.\nSection 5329 authorizes federal oversight of rail transit safety (SSO program) and vests DOT with oversight, investigative, inspection, subpoena, and enforcement powers.\nAdditional information on the Section 5329, Public Transportation Safety Program, is available through the FTA Safety and Oversight Office.\nk. State of Good Repair Formula Program (Section 5337).\nThe State of Good Repair Grants Program is authorized by 49 U.S.C. 5337.  The Secretary may make grants under this section to assist state and local governmental authorities to develop and implement a transit asset management plan (TAM).  Other grants under this section provide financial assistance for in capital projects to maintain public transportation systems in a state of good repair, including projects to replace and rehabilitate: rolling stock, track, line equipment, structures, signals, communications, power equipment, power substations, passenger stations, passenger terminals, security equipment, and security systems; maintenance facilities and maintenance equipment; operational support equipment, including computer hardware and software; and other replacement and rehabilitation projects the Secretary determines appropriate.  Additional information on the Section 5337 State of Good Repair Formula Program is available in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 5300.1, \u201cState of Good Repair Grant Program: Guidance and Application Instructions.\u201d\nl. Buses and Bus Facilities Program (Section 5339).\nThe Grants for Buses and Bus Facilities program (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5339) makes federal assistance available to states and eligible recipients to replace, rehabilitate and purchase buses and related equipment and to construct bus-related facilities including technological changes or innovations to modify low or no emission vehicles or facilities.\nFunding is provided through formula allocations and competitive grants.  A sub-program provides competitive Awards for bus and bus facility projects that support low and zero-emission vehicles.\nFunding under the Award can be made available to eligible recipients (and their subrecipients) that operate fixed route bus and/or demand response services or that allocate funding to fixed route bus and/or demand response operators, state or local governmental entities, and federally recognized Indian tribes that operate fixed route bus service that are eligible to receive direct grants under Sections 5307 and 5311.\nAdditional information on the Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities Formula Program, including transfer provisions to Section 5307, can be found in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 5100.1, \u201cBus and Bus Facilities Program: Guidance and Application Instructions.\u201d\nm. Transit-Oriented Development Planning Pilot Program.\nThe Transit-Oriented Development Planning Pilot Program was established by Section 20005(b) of MAP-21.  This program provides federal assistance to advance planning efforts that support transit-oriented development (TOD) associated with new fixed guideway and core capacity improvement projects, as defined under Section 5309.  TOD focuses growth around transit stations to improve the resiliency and reliability of the transportation system, promote ridership, promote affordable housing near transit, revitalize downtown centers and neighborhoods, and encourage local economic development, tourism, and natural risk reduction.\nFederal assistance under Section 5307 may be used to support planning projects that receive federal assi", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "ecdbfeef-9e8e-4c3c-afd8-4f1f8ea361e5"}, "5550243838768043048": {"text": "stance under this program, or may be used for capital projects relating to TOD projects.\nn.

CROSS-CUTTING REQUIREMENTS.  The recipient understands and agrees that it must comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and requirements, except to the extent that FTA determines otherwise, in writing.\nADMINISTRATION OF THE AWARD\n1. OVERVIEW.  This chapter discusses the mechanics and requirements for post-award administration of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement (Award) after the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has awarded federal assistance and the recipient has executed the Grant Agreement or Cooperative Agreement in FTA\u2019s Transit Award Management System (TrAMS).  This chapter emphasizes the requirements associated with administering and managing an Award.  Project management and asset management requirements are described in Chapter IV.\nThe Award Life Cycle is as follows:\na. Award application developed and transmitted to FTA,\nb. Initial reviews completed,\nc. Application determined to be complete,\nd. Award number assigned,\ne. Application submitted to FTA,\nf. Signoffs and Approvals,\ng. Award funds reserved,\nh. Funds obligated (or awarded) by FTA,\ni. Award executed by recipient,\nj. Award implemented, monitored and managed, and\nk. Award closed.\nIn order to better understand the sequence of actions and the related administrative requirements, the life cycle leading to an Award is outlined in broad terms, with the pre-award and post-award phases separated.\nDuring the pre-award phase, FTA performs various actions, including soliciting applications (whether formally through a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) or informally), reviewing and selecting successful proposals, as well as creating administrative and fiscal accounts, such as assigning the Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN), other reference numbers, and reserving federal assistance.  The applicant is responsible for drafting a proposal in response to the requirements of the solicitation, preparing related documents, and submitting the application in TrAMS.  The pre-award phase ends when FTA obligates (awards) federal assistance for the project(s), and related activities, to be supported through\nthe Award of the Grant Agreement or Cooperative Agreement, as described in the application.  The recipient then executes the Award.\nOnce the Award is executed, the applicant becomes the recipient and the post-award phase begins.  During this phase, the recipient implements each project and related activities supported under its Award, administers its Award based on the terms and conditions identified in the Grant Agreement or Cooperative Agreement that accompany the Award, and works with FTA to complete the Award within its Award Budget and on schedule.  FTA is responsible for monitoring the Award and assisting in the effective management of the terms of the accompanying Grant Agreement or Cooperative Agreement, including reviewing required reports and Award modification requests.\nOnce the period of performance, as referenced in the Award, has ended, the closeout of the Award can begin.  The Award is considered closed when the recipient has completed and submitted the documents required for closeout in TrAMS and FTA has accepted these documents.  These documents and reports include the recipient\u2019s final reconciled budget and final Federal Financial Report (FFR) and Milestone Progress Report (MPR) in TrAMS.  Records should be maintained as provided in the established retention schedule, see Section 7 of this Chapter, \u201cRetention and Access Requirements for Records.\u201d\n2. APPLICATION PROCESS.  FTA\u2019s program-specific circulars describe the Award application process and requirements.  Refer to these circulars for instructions for completing an Award application.  For a full listing of FTA program circulars, as of the date of publication of this circular, see Appendix A of this circular or visit www.fta.dot.gov.\nFTA provides a streamlined electronic interface between recipients and FTA that allows complete electronic application submission, review, approval, and management of all Awards.  This system incorporates field commands found in standard forms, such as SF-424, etc.  The applicant must use TrAMS to apply for federal assistance from FTA, manage its Grant or Cooperative Agreement from Award to Closeout, file the required financial status reports and milestone progress reports, upload applicable civil rights programs, and submit its annual Certifications and Assurances.  Please contact your FTA point of contact for information regarding FTA\u2019s current electronic award management system.\nEach Grant or Cooperative Agreement includes, at a minimum:\na. Description of the overall Award scope of work summarizing each Project and related activities that will receive federal assistance under the Award as stated in the Award Budget;\nb. Separate narrative, budgets, and schedules for each activity supported under the Award;\nc. The Award Budget, consisting of all the costs associated with the scope of work encompassed in the Award;\nd. Any special conditions within the Agreement or incorporated by reference and made part of the Agreement, such as Department of Labor requirements;\ne. The period of performance of the entire Award delineated by the start and end dates of the Award during which time projects and related activities are expected to be completed and the federal assistance expended;\nf. The identification of whether pre-award authority has been exercised for the Award and submission of an initial Federal Financial Report,, if pre-award authority was exercised, and\ng. Any other documents attached to the application, incorporated by reference and made part of each Grant or Cooperative Agreement that apply to the Award including the Master Agreement, the recipient\u2019s Certifications and Assurances submitted each fiscal year, and other relevant documents.\nNote: Once FTA obligates federal assistance through the Award, the applicant must execute the Award in TrAMS within 90 days; otherwise FTA may withdraw its Award.  Once the Award is executed, it is considered \u201cactive\u201d and the recipient must comply with post-award administration requirements.\n3. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  When the Award is active, the recipient must comply with post-award reporting requirements.  FTA\u2019s policy for reporting requirements may vary depending on the size of the recipient or the type or amount of federal assistance the recipient receives.  The Award may include special reporting requirements.  These are typically identified by program and may be included in Federal Register notices, apportionment notices, and program circulars.  Please contact your FTA point of contact with questions regarding the applicability of the following reporting requirements.   a. General Reporting Purpose.  The FTA post-award review may consider whether the following factors are progressing as outlined in the Grant or Cooperative Agreement:  (1) The purposes of the Award are being achieved,\n(2) The Award is progressing as scheduled and within its Award Budget,\n(3) The recipient is demonstrating competence and control in implementing the scope of work encompassed by the Award, and\n(4) The Award meets all program requirements, and all performance measures are being captured.\nFTA monitors projects and related activities under the Award to ensure proper recipient stewardship of federal assistance and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and requirements.  FTA\u2019s monitoring continues throughout the period of performance.  Should a problem develop, FTA may become involved to assist in its resolution.  FTA also must be able to report on program results, industry trends, and its own oversight responsibilities.  Recipients submit the information FTA needs for program forecasting and management through the FFR and narrative MPR detailing progress, significant events, relevant activities, and any changes to or variances in the Award Budget or schedule.\nWith respect to the level of detail required for these reports, FTA treats all approved activity line items (ALIs) alike.  Thus, an activity contained under the Award must be presented in the reports in sufficient detail that important information is not lost in the aggregation.  For example, the number of full-size buses supported under the Award must not be reported together with vans under the scope code for \u201crolling stock,\u201d but instead should be reported separately under the applicable ALI.  FTA staff is available to assist recipients to determine and agree on the appropriate level of reporting detail and formats.  This will ensure that FTA has the information needed to manage its overall program.\nAll recipients should report significant developments or changes as they occur during the year, including any problems, delays, or adverse conditions that may materially impair the ability to meet the objective(s) of the Award, as well as any favorable developments that may enable meeting time schedules and objectives sooner or at a cost substantially lower than expected in the FFRs.  If the Award requires a change in the overall end date of the Agreement,", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "23309d75-f74f-43e3-94c0-95146f18cbff"}, "262371245806228800": {"text": " the recipient should consult the FTA Regional Office to determine if the change to the overall end date will be made through a budget revision or an amendment. Adjustments to individual activities may be made as part of the MPR.\nRecipients must file their FFRs and MPRs through TrAMS.  Recipients may attach supplemental information accompanying the FFRs and MPRs; however, attachments may not be submitted in lieu of completing and submitting the FFR and MPR via TrAMS.\nFTA may withhold payment for failure to submit either FFRs or MPRs in a timely manner.  In limited instances, FTA may grant extensions of report due dates for good cause.  For recipients that report quarterly, an extension may be granted up to the day prior to the next quarter reporting cycle (for example, a report due on January 30, may receive an extension with a due date no later than March 30.  This is necessary to ensure information is captured for the next reporting cycle beginning on April 1).  Recipients that report annually must report by October 30.  FTA, or the recipient, may request to make modifications to a submitted quarterly or annual report; however, any corrections must be completed and resubmitted within 60 days after the original due date.  Recipients that report annually may be granted an additional 60 days for a justified reason (following the same format for recipients that report quarterly).\nPlease contact your FTA regional or metropolitan office for questions regarding any reporting requirements or report due dates.\nb. Reports of Significant Events.  Unforeseen events that impact the schedule, cost, capacity, usefulness, or purpose of the Award, including the terms and conditions applicable to the Award must be reported to FTA immediately and then reflected in the next Milestone Progress Report.  A separate special reports should be submitted when:  (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions will affect the recipient\u2019s ability to achieve the objectives of the Award within the scheduled time period or Award Budget.  The report should discuss actions taken and/or contemplated and any federal assistance needed to resolve the situation.  If the Award requires a change in the overall end date of the Agreement, the recipient should consult the FTA Regional\nOffice to determine if the change to the overall end date will be made through a budget revision or an amendment.  .\n(2) Favorable developments will enable the recipient to achieve project goals/complete project activities ahead of schedule or at lower cost.\nc. Federal Financial Report (FFR).  FTA\u2019s electronic FFR report is consistent with and includes information identified in OMB\u2019s Standard Form FFR (SF FFR).  A recipient must submit an FFR for each active Award.  The FFR accompanies the MPR (described below) and is used to monitor the federal assistance awarded.  The purpose of the FFR is to provide a current, complete, and accurate financial picture of the Award.  This report is submitted electronically through TrAMS. The first 4 items (A-D) are prepared using cash accounting. The remaining report items (E-U) must be prepared on the accrual basis of accounting; that is, income is recorded when earned instead of when received, and expenses are recorded when incurred instead of when paid.  These items, (E-U) of the FFR, may not be prepared on the cash basis of accounting, even though a recipient may keep its books on the cash basis during its accounting year.  If this is the case, at the submission of the FFR, the recipient must prepare the necessary accruals and submit the FFR on the accrual basis of accounting.  (See Appendix B, \u201cFederal Financial Report\u201d).\nThe FFR must contain the following elements:\n(1) All financial facts (e.g., expenditures and obligations) relating to the Award (scope of work and supporting activities); the purpose of each financial report and applicable reporting period should be completely and clearly displayed in the reports.\n(2) Reported financial data should be accurate to the last Award Budget (this may be the initial Award, or last revision to the Award Budget or amendment to the Award) and the reporting period.  The requirement for accuracy does not rule out inclusion of reasonable estimates when precise measurement is impractical, uneconomical, unnecessary, or conducive to delay.  Financial data reported may reconcile data included in the prior report, and must be explained in the explanation/remarks section of the report.\n(3) Financial reports must be based on the required supporting documentation maintained in the recipient\u2019s official financial management system that produces information that objectively discloses financial aspects of events or transactions.\n(4) Financial data reported should be derived from accounts that are maintained on a consistent, periodic basis; material changes in accounting policies or methods and their effect must be clearly explained.\n(5) Reporting terminology used in financial reports to FTA should be consistent with receipt and expense classifications included in the latest Award.\n(6) The recipient is responsible for indicating whether or not it is charging indirect costs to the Award at the time of application.  If the recipient is charging indirect\ncosts to the Award, the recipient is responsible for having an approved Indirect Cost Rate Proposal or Cost Allocation Plan approved by the cognizant agency on file, and uploading the documentation into their TrAMS \u201cRecipient Profile.\u201d The recipient must report on related indirect expenditures.\n(7) The recipient must provide financial information related to the FFR categories: Federal Cash, Recipient Share, Unliquidated Obligations, and Program Income.\n(8) The recipient must provide remarks to help explain the report, in particular any reconciliation (e.g., refunds) identified in the report.  The recipient must also certify or attest that the information provided is accurate.\nd. Milestone Progress Reports (MPR).  The MPRs must be submitted for each active Award.  The MPR is the primary written communication between the recipient and FTA.  This report must be submitted electronically.  If only operating assistance is included in the Award, the reporting requirements are limited to the actual dates when all federal assistance has been expended.\nThe information provided in MPR reports should be as complete as possible, highlighting progress toward project objectives and any potential problem areas.\nEach MPR must include the following data as appropriate:\n(1) The current status, at a minimum, of each milestone that has passed during the prior reporting period, within an active Award.  FTA, at its discretion, may request a recipient to update each milestone within an active Award.  MPRs should identify: a) The actual completion dates for any milestones completed during the reporting period, and\nb) Any revised dates when any original (or last revised) completion dates were not met.\nc) If the milestone date exceeds the Award end date, the recipient should consult the FTA Regional Office to determine if the change to the Award end date will be made through a budget revision or an amendment.\n(2) A narrative of the activity status, any problems encountered in implementation, specification preparation, bid solicitation, resolution of protests, and third-party contract Awards.\n(3) A detailed discussion of all Award Budget or schedule changes.\n(4) An explanation of why scheduled milestones or completion dates were not met.\n(5) Identification of problem areas and a narrative on how the problems will be solved.\n(6) A discussion of the expected impacts and the efforts to recover from the delays.\n(7) An analysis of each significant project cost variance: Completion and acceptance of equipment and construction or other work should be discussed, together with a breakout of the costs incurred and those costs required to complete the project.  Use quantitative measures, such as hours worked, sections completed, or units delivered.\n(8) A list of all outstanding claims exceeding $100,000, and all claims settled during the reporting period.  This list should be accompanied by a brief description, estimated costs, and the reasons for the claims.\n(9) A list of all potential and executed change orders, as defined in Circular 4220.1, and amounts exceeding $100,000, pending or settled, during the reporting period.  This list should be accompanied by a brief description.  Identification of change orders does not imply notification, acceptance, or approval of budgetary changes that might be required.\n(10) A list of claims or litigation involving third-party contracts and potential third-party contracts that: a) Have a value exceeding $100,000;\nb) Involve a controversial matter, irrespective of amount; or\nc) Involve a highly publicized matter, irrespective of amount.\n(11) A list of all real property acquisition actions, including just compensation, property or properties under litigation, administrative settlements, and condemnation for each parcel during the reporting period.\n(12) All rolling stock ALIs must include a milestone for Contract Award.\ne. Report Due Dates.  For FFRs and MPRs, the following reporting dates apply: (1) Recipients located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more populations.  Recipients located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more populations who receive more than $1 million in funds from FTA, FFRs and MPRs must be submitted and are due to FTA within 30 days after the end of each quarter, i.e., by January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30.  The FTA regional or metropolitan office may request more frequent reporting or additional reports if circumstances warrant additional reporting.\nRecipients located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more populations who receive less than $1 million in funds from FTA, FFRs and MPRs must be submitted and are due October 30, one month after the federal fiscal year (FY) ends.  The FTA regional or metropolitan office may request more fre", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "7367d68c-32a0-4840-b136-3ca575b70f93"}, "6570026672197049449": {"text": "quent reporting or additional reports if circumstances warrant additional reporting.\n(2) Recipients located in urbanized areas of less than 200,000 populations.  FFRs and MPRs must be submitted and are due October 30, one month after the federal fiscal year (FY) ends.  The FTA regional or metropolitan office may request more frequent reporting or additional reports if circumstances warrant additional reporting.\n(3) FTA may utilize a risk based approach to change the frequency of reporting requirements for a particular Award or recipient.  This will be noted in the Grant Agreement or Cooperative Agreement.\n(4) Exceptions:  a) Section 5309 Grants: All grant recipients, regardless of location and population area, are required to submit quarterly reports in TrAMS according to the dates in subsection 3.e.(1) above when grants include construction of facility.\nb) State Departments of Transportation (State DOTs): State DOTs are required to report annually for all state administered programs; this includes Sections 5303, 5304, 5307 (Governor\u2019s Apportionment), 5310, 5311, former Section 5316, and former Section 5317 programs.  The exception described in the preceding paragraph applies to the State DOTs.\nc) If the provisions of this FTA Circular 5010.1 differ from the provisions of the applicable FTA Programmatic Circular, the Program Circular takes precedence.  FTA at its discretion may always require more stringent reporting or specialized reports.  Depending on project complexity, at its discretion, FTA may also request other special reports or quarterly project management meetings.\nf. Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) Subaward and Executive Compensation Reporting.  Recipients awarded new federal assistance greater than or equal to $25,000 as of October 1, 2010, are subject to FFATA subaward and executive compensation reporting requirements as outlined in the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s guidance issued August 27, 2010.  These recipients must file an FFATA subaward report by the end of the month following the month in which the recipient awards any subaward greater than or equal to $25,000.  Additionally, all recipients must report the names and compensation of their five most highly compensated officers, and first-tier subrecipients must report the names and compensation of their five most highly compensated officers, if in the preceding fiscal year they received 80 percent or more of their annual gross revenues in federal Awards; and $25,000 or more in annual gross revenues from federal Awards; and the public does not have access to this information about the compensation of the senior executives of those recipients or subrecipients through periodic reports filed under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(a), \u00a7 78o(d), or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\nInstructions and the FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) can be found at: www.fsrs.gov.\ng. Reports and Other Materials Produced by the Recipient.  All reports, presentations, and other products resulting from FTA sponsorship reports (federal assistance or non-financial sponsorship) must contain the following acknowledgment and disclaimer:\nDISCLAIMER NOTICE\nThis document is disseminated under the sponsorship of the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Transit Administration, in the interest of information exchange.  The United States Government assumes no liability for the contents or use thereof.\nThe United States Government does not endorse products or manufacturers.  Any trade or manufacturers\u2019 names appear herein solely because they are considered essential to the contents of the report.\nh. Associated Transit Improvement Reports.  Associated Transit Improvement Reports (also, Transit Enhancement Reports for Awards made before MAP-21 was signed into law) must be submitted by recipients with populations of 200,000 or more that receive federal assistance under the Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307).  Recipients of this federal assistance are required by Section 5307(c)(1)(K) to submit a report listing the associated transit improvement projects carried out during the previous FY with that federal assistance including the amounts expended.  Refer to the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9030.1, \u201cUrbanized Area Formula Program: Program Guidance and Application Instructions,\u201d for reporting requirements.  Certification that the Associated Transit Improvement Report or Transit Enhancement Report has been submitted is required as part of the Annual List of Certifications and Assurances.\ni. Civil Rights Reports.  Recipients, as a prerequisite for federal assistance, must comply with certain civil rights requirements and routinely evaluate if their compliance requirements change. (1) Title VI.  Recipients must submit, on a triennial basis, a report of their compliance with the objectives of the most recent edition of FTA Circular 4702.1, \u201cTitle VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients.\u201d FTA Circular 4702.1 provides details on the contents of compliance reports.\n(2) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program.  Recipients meeting the FTA-assisted contracting threshold at 49 CFR \u00a7 26.21(a)(2) must report on the following DBE program requirements:   a) DBE Program.  Recipients meeting the threshold set forth in 49 CFR \u00a7 26.21(a)(2) must submit to FTA a DBE program that includes all the required elements specified in 49 CFR part 26.  Recipients do not need to submit regular updates of the DBE program once FTA has approved it, however significant changes to the program must be submitted for approval.\nb) DBE Goals.  DBE goal setting requirements apply to recipients that will award cumulative contracts (excluding vehicle purchases) exceeding $250,000 in FTA funds in any given fiscal year.  These recipients are required to provide DBE goals to FTA by August 1 on a triennial basis, and\nc) Uniform Report of DBE Awards or Commitments and Payments.  Recipients for which the DBE goals apply are required to submit the Uniform Report of DBE Awards or Commitments and Payments (the Semi-Annual Report) by June 1 and December 1 of each year.  By June 1, the recipient must report on all FTA-funded contracts awarded and/or completed and ongoing DBE activity for the first half of the federal fiscal year (October 1 to March 31).  By December 1, the recipient must report on all FTA-funded contracts awarded and/or completed and ongoing DBE activity for the second half of the federal fiscal year (April 1 to September 30).  Reports are completed by filling out the reporting form available in FTA\u2019s Electronic Awards Management System.\nd) Reporting Transit Vehicle Manufacturers.  Within 30 days after entering into a contract for any federally-funded transit vehicle purchase, the Recipient must submit to FTA the name of the TVM contractor and the total dollar value of the third-party contract using the online Transit Vehicle Award Reporting Form.  Recipients must also submit the online Transit Vehicle Award Reporting Form within 30 days of exercising an option or a piggyback on an existing contract, or ordering a vehicle from an authorized schedule.  The list of DBE-certified TVMs can be found on FTA\u2019s Web site at https://www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/civil-rights-ada/eligible-transit-vehicle-manufacturers.\nTo the extent that a vehicle remanufacturer is responding to a solicitation for new or remanufactured vehicles with a vehicle to which the remanufacturer has provided post-production alterations or retrofitting (e.g., replacing major components such as an engine to provide a \u201clike new\u201d vehicle), the vehicle remanufacturer is considered a transit vehicle manufacturer.\nFurther instructions for reporting vehicle purchases can be found on FTA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights Web site.\n(3) Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO).  Recipients covered under the most recent edition of FTA Circular 4704.1, which addresses EEO matters, must submit triennial reports on their compliance with this circular.  FTA EEO program reporting requirements apply to State recipients and recipients that employ 100 or more transit-related employees and receive capital or operating assistance in excess of $1 million, or receive $250,000 or more from FTA for planning purposes.  The most recent edition of FTA Circular 4704.1 provides details on the contents of EEO compliance reports.\nj. National Transit Database (NTD) Reporting.  Congress established the NTD to be the Nation\u2019s primary source for information and statistics pertaining to the transit systems within the United States.  NTD data are used to support numerous DOT programs and to \u201chelp meet the needs of individual public transportation systems, the United States Government, state and local governments, and the public for information on which to base public transportation service planning.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5335.\nThe legislative authority for the NTD is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5335.  FTA implemented NTD requirements through the NTD Rule, 49 CFR part 630.  A recipient or subrecipient of federal assistance from FTA that is required to report to the NTD must provide a complete report of all transit operations, regardless of whether those operations are or are not financed in whole or in part by FTA.  Financial information reported to the NTD must be reported in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts (USOA).  The complete reporting requirements for the NTD, along with information on due dates, extensions, and waivers can be found in the current versions of the NTD Reporting Manuals.  The NTD Rule, the USOA, and the latest versions of the NTD Reporting Manuals can be found on FTA\u2019s NTD Web site at www.transit.dot.gov/ntd.\n(1) Applicability. A recipient, subrecipient, or beneficiary of funds from FTA\u2019s Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307) or Rural Areas Formula Program (Section 5311) is required by law to report t", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "2bba694b-c3a6-4fc4-8108-2a1013f75415"}, "9205241905714361894": {"text": "o the NTD.  In addition, recipients or subrecipients of funds for public transportation services from any other FTA Program, including FTA\u2019s Formula Program for Special Services for the Elderly and Disabled (Section 5310), must complete the asset management reporting requirements.\n(2) Small Systems Waiver. A system that operates 30 or fewer vehicles across all modes in an urbanized area may receive a small systems waiver upon request.  Systems requesting and receiving a small systems waiver have reduced requirements for their annual reports.  In addition, these systems are exempted from the monthly reports and the safety module report.   These systems must still annually report data on sources of revenue, operating expenses, capital expenses, service operations, organizational relationships, safety data, capital assets, and state of good repair performance targets.  These systems are exempt, however, from collecting and reporting data on total passenger miles.\n(3) Annual Reports (Tribes).  An Indian Tribe receiving funds under FTA\u2019s Tribal Transit Program must report annually to the NTD.  The reporting requirements for Tribes are identical to those for the Small Systems Waiver systems listed above.\n(4) Annual Reports (Rural, Other than Tribal Transit). State Departments of Transportation file annual NTD reports on behalf of their subrecipients, except those subrecipients that are otherwise reporting directly to the NTD.  Subrecipients of the Section 5311 Program are required to assist their State DOT in completing the annual NTD reporting requirements.  These requirements are identical to those for Small Systems Waiver systems listed above.\n(5) Annual Reports (Other than Sections 5307 or 5311). Recipients of other grants from FTA for public transportation services to the NTD must annually report organizational information, a capital asset inventory, condition assessments, and state of good repair performance targets.  Recipients of these grants with subrecipients, must report the same information to the NTD on behalf of those subrecipients - this includes Section 5310 subrecipients that provide public transportation services.\n(6) Annual Reports. Recipients of Section 5307 grants that do not receive a small systems waiver must file a full annual report.  The full annual report includes data on sources of revenue, operating expenses, capital expenses, service operations, organizational relationships, total employees, fuel consumption, capital assets, and state of good repair performance targets.\n(7) Monthly Reports. Recipients of Section 5307 grants that do not receive a small systems waiver must file a monthly report on transit operations, including unlinked passenger trips, vehicle revenue miles, vehicle revenue hours, and vehicles operated in maximum service on each mode.\n(8) Safety Reports. Recipients of Section 5307 grants that do not receive a small systems waiver must report safety data to the NTD each month.  A detailed report is required within 30 days of each safety event that meets the major event reporting threshold, including any event with a fatality, significant property damage, or serious injuries, among others.  A summary report is required each month of certain events that do not meet the major event reporting threshold.  Consult the NTD Reporting Manuals for specific requirements.\nk. Quarterly Reports for Major Capital Construction Projects.  Major Capital Construction Projects must submit a quarterly project budget and project schedule and may require additional reporting (See Chapter IV, \u201cDesign and Construction of Facilities Projects.\u201d)\n4. MODIFICATIONS TO THE AWARD.  At times, it may be necessary to modify the Award by revising the Award Budget or amending the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  The recipient is responsible for managing and monitoring each project and related activities under the Award to ensure that all projects and related activities are carried out in accordance with the Award Budget.\nEach federal assistance program has specific requirements that are included in each FTA program circular that should be referenced before contemplating a modification to the Award.  For example, for federal assistance under Section 5307, each associated transit improvement (previously transit enhancement) must be used for activities eligible under the statute authorizing its federal assistance.  Another example is that federal assistance for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) complementary paratransit service as a capital project may not exceed 10 percent, (or in some cases 20 percent, to the extent authorized by federal law) of its annual apportionment under Section 5307 and 5311.  Sections 5310 and 5311 also have specific requirements for modifications to Awards that are addressed in the FTA program application circulars.  Federal assistance flexed from other programs, such as\nthe Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Improvement Program or the Surface Transportation Program (STP), may have additional requirements that are addressed in other guidance that must be considered before modifying the Award.\nThe manner in which the Award Budget is initially structured during the application phase can facilitate or impede project management, particularly when unforeseen events require changes to the Award.\nThere are three ways to modify the Award: (1) through a revision to the Award Budget, (2) through an Administrative Amendment, or (3) through an Amendment.  The recipient should contact the FTA regional or metropolitan office for questions relating to requests for a modification to its Award, including which type of modification is appropriate for the proposed action.  Modifications are electronically submitted, reviewed, and approved in TrAMS.\nAward modifications must be approved in TrAMS to maintain an active Award Budget and Amendment.  An Active Budget is required to ensure the recipient can seek reimbursement consistent with the newly approved changes to the Award Budget.\na. Award Budget Revisions  (1) General.  A revision to the Award Budget may be made as long as there is no change to the purpose and the scope of work and no change to the type of and/or amount of federal assistance awarded, regardless of the FY for which the federal assistance was appropriated.\nWhether a revision to the Award Budget may be permitted or whether an Amendment to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement will be necessary depends on the effect of the proposed change(s).\nThe following items assist in determining if the proposed change is appropriate to be made as an Award budget revision:\na) Revisions to the Award Budget are generally changes to ALI amounts, when the same funding source is applied or when minor adjustments are made to descriptions of activities.  For example, if an ALI is added to an existing scope code to delineate better the existing activities or to reallocate funds between existing ALIs when one ALI has completed its scope of work and a surplus of funds remains available, then a revision to the Award Budget may be appropriate.\nHowever, if the proposed action results in all of the ALIs within a scope code being reduced to zero, and the scope code is, therefore, zeroed out, then the recipient should consult with the Regional Office as to whether the action  may necessitate an amendment.\nb) Revisions to an Award Budget must be consistent with the activities contained in an approved STIP.\nc) Revisions to an Award Budget may not alter the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) determinations pertaining to the current Award.  Note that, the addition of an activity to an existing scope code may be a revision to the Award Budget when it can be satisfied under the current NEPA of the Award, or it has satisfied NEPA independently.\n(2) Procedures.  A revision to an Award Budget must be submitted electronically through TrAMS.  A request for a revision to an Award Budget request must include a reason for the revision.  Any revision to an existing ALI in an Award Budget must be accompanied by a brief explanation to explain the impact of the change on the project, and the Grant or Cooperative Agreement as a whole.  If necessary, additional information may be attached in TrAMS.  The FTA reviewer will return an incomplete revision to an Award Budget to the recipient for inclusion of additional information.\nRevisions to an Award Budget may be performed to active Awards regardless of whether they were initially awarded under an older FTA electronic award management system (i.e., TEAM or TrAMS).\nRevisions to the Award Budget may be sent to the Department of Labor (DOL) for informational purposes but the labor protection arrangements for the original Award will apply to any modifications without further DOL certification.\nIn certain circumstances, a recipient must receive FTA\u2019s prior approval of a revision to an Award Budget before incurring costs.  The request should be made as a revision to an Award Budget in TrAMS and must explain and justify the proposed revision and outline the proposed changes to confirm it is a valid revision to the Award Budget and not an Amendment.  FTA must document its review and concurrence before the recipient can incur costs associated with the proposed change.\nFTA\u2019s prior approval is required when the proposed revision to an Award Budget meets any of the following criteria:\na) The revision results from changes in the scope of work or the objective of the project or program;\nb) Additional federal funds are needed to complete the project;\nc) A revision involves specific costs for which prior written approval is required in accordance with applicable OMB cost principles listed in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E\u2014Cost Principles.\nd) For equipment, when the federal share of the Award exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000, at the time of publication of this circular) and the cumulative amount of change exceeds 20 percent from the latest budget approved by FTA (eithe", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "2874b005-d506-4d83-b8b4-7e0c549abb47"}, "693222440766942355": {"text": "r in the original application, or as modified in\nan amendment, or as approved by FTA in a budget revision), provided it does not alter the scope of work of the Award.\ne) The federal assistance source is the same and is transferred between ALIs, within each Project or across the Projects with different federal matching ratios.  For example, moving federal assistance from a capital activity with a match ratio of 80/20 to an operating activity with a match ratio of 50/50 requires a revision to the Award Budget.  Certain revisions may require a financial purpose code (FPC) transfer (e.g., prior TEAM Grants and Cooperative Agreements that are migrated to TrAMS).\nf) Changing the federal share of an existing ALI, such as changing an ALI from 80/20 to 85/15 to account for compliance with ADA or CAA requirements.\ng) The addition of an ALI to an existing scope of work approved for the Award, provided that the request does not change the source or amount of federal assistance originally awarded or change the scope of work of the Award and its Projects.\nAny change within an approved scope of work requires that the recipient affirm in its request for a revision to an Award Budget that the new activity is consistent with the approved TIP (if applicable) and STIP; and, if applicable, has satisfied NEPA requirements.  For example, if a construction management ALI was included for third-party contractors, but now a portion of the funds will be used for force account construction management, the intended scope of work remains the same.  If the addition of an activity included a scope of work to install/construct bus shelters, but the applicant desired to use a portion of the awarded funds now for the design of the bus shelters, a revision to the Award Budget could be used to add that new related activity since it leads to the completion of the approved scope of work.\nh) An Award under a competitive program has certain limitations and requirements when considering changes to the Award Budget.  Therefore, before proceeding with any changes (Revision to an Award Budget or Amendment to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement), the recipient should notify its FTA point of contact first for direction.\n(3) Financial Purpose Code (FPC) Transfers.  When a revision to the Award Budget includes a transfer of federal assistance between capital/operating/planning activities, FTA must concur (approve) in the change in the electronic award management system before the recipient is able to draw down federal assistance for the changed purpose.  The recipient should understand that a change in a FPC may result in a change to the overall non-federal share depending on the required matching ratios.  This is only applicable to federal assistance previously awarded under TEAM.\n(4) Period of Performance: Any changes to the Period of Performance, meaning the beginning or end date of the Award, may be made through a budget revision or an amendment with prior FTA approval.  No new expenditures should be made beyond the end date of an Award.  The recipient should consult the FTA Regional Office to determine if the change to the Award end date will be made through a budget revision or an amendment.\n(5) Rolling Stock Changes: A recipient must continue to meet FTA\u2019s rolling stock spare ratio requirements for any change in the number of revenue rolling stock.      If the change in the number of the approved Award impacts its spare ratios, the recipient must validate the change in its Rolling Stock Status Report.  FTA prior approval is required for Fixed Guideway Capital Investment Program projects \u2013 New and Small Starts and Core Capacity Improvements (Section 5309).  Section 5309 recipients should consult with the FTA Regional Office.\nb. Administrative Amendments to Awards.  An Administrative Amendment is initiated by FTA and may only be used when there is no change to the scope of work, amount or purpose of the Award.\nAn Administrative Amendment may be used for the following reasons:\n(1) To change or clarify the terms, conditions, or provisions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement; or\n(2) To change the fiscal year or type of federal assistance obligated for the Award; or\n(3) To deobligate federal assistance that is no longer needed to complete the approved project scope of work or purpose, without closing the Award.\nc. Amendments to Awards.   (1) General.  A new amendment to a Grant or Cooperative Agreement must meet the same application requirements as a request for a new Award.  Each Amendment is subject to DOL certification to the extent required by law.\nA new amendment to an Award made previously under TEAM and migrated into TrAMS, is restricted and must be coordinated with your regional office prior to incurring costs and initiating the Amendment.\nFTA requires an Amendment to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement if the request changes the scope of work of the Award.  For example, the applicant need not resubmit environmental documentation for activities approved under the original Award or prior approved amendment.  However, if the amendment includes new activities, requisite documentation should be provided; such as, environmental reviews and TIP/STIP information.\n(2) An Amendment to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  An Amendment to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement is required when there is either a change in the scope of work or addition of federal assistance to an existing Award (regardless if the source of assistance is the same or different).  Amendments will be required when the Award includes multiple sources of financial assistance and the action requires the addition of a new Scope Code to a Project.\nA new amendment to a Grant or Cooperative Agreement must meet the same application requirements as a request for a new Award.  Each Amendment is subject to DOL certification to the extent required by law.\n(3) Procedure.  All amendments must be submitted electronically through TrAMS.  Amendments to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement require a revised Grant or Cooperative Agreement and revised Award Budget, and may require additional milestones adjusting the schedule of one or more Projects therein, or a change in the amount or program/source(s) of federal assistance obligated for the Award.  The Amendment must meet the same requirements as a request for a new Award except that the recipient need not resubmit portions of the application for its original Award that are unaffected by the change.\nThe Recipient must describe the reason for the Amendment and the changes to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement, include a detailed description of each change and a revised Award Budget, and update the period of performance, if applicable (this may also require additional milestones).  To delineate the Amendment, the recipient should include a header (e.g., \u201cAmendment #1,\u201d) in each narrative section, including the Executive Summary, the Project narrative and the extended details of the associated ALI.\nFTA requires an Amendment to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement if the request changes the scope of work of the Award.  Amendments to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement include (Note: this list is not exhaustive):\na) A change in the project location, NEPA determination, or in the quantity of items to be purchased or constructed that substantially changes the purpose or intent of the Award.\nb) The addition of a new Project to the Award, or the division of an existing Project into multiple Projects, or deletion of a Project included in the Award.\nc) The addition or deletion of a Scope Code to an existing Project.\nd) The addition of an ALI to an existing Scope Code when it adds new independent scope of work to the Project, meaning, it is not associated with/or support other existing activities included in the Award.\ne) Change to Period of Performance, meaning, the beginning and end date of the Award.  The Period of Performance may be modified by amending the Award or by submitting an Award budget revision.  The recipient should consult the\nFTA Regional Office to determine if the change to the Period of Performance will be made through a budget revision or an amendment. No new expenditures should be made beyond the completion date of an Award.\nf) The request will increase or decrease the total amount of the federal funding of the Award.\ng) The federal program authorizing the Award is substituted (deobligate/reobligate), even if the total amount remains the same.\nh) The action will add a second program of federal assistance to the Award, even if the total federal Award amount remains the same.\n(4) Deobligation.  A change in federal assistance may occur when a recipient elects to deobligate one source of federal assistance and apply a different source; this may be part of the amount or the whole amount.\nIf the scope of work is unchanged and the only action is the deobligation of federal assistance, an Administrative Amendment may be used to process the modification to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  See Chapter III, subsection 4.b, \u201cAdministrative Amendment,\u201d above.\n(5) Change to Discretionary Awards or Earmarks.  A change to an Award resulting from a congressional earmark or a competitively selected discretionary program, must be consistent with the original intent of the congressional language authorizing the Award or activities included in the original discretionary application as outlined in the applicable Notice of Award.  For example, if the congressional earmark is only for a facility, an Amendment cannot add a scope of work for vehicles without explicit direction from Congress to FTA to change the earmark.  Likewise, discretionary Awards require concurrence from the FTA Headquarters and/or Office of the Secretary.  Before initiating an Amendment, contact your FTA regional or metropolitan office for assistance in making this determination.\n(6) Transfer of Assets from One Transit Property to Another Transit Property.  Any transfer of an asset that has an acti", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "61c1846b-0a19-4664-86ed-7ab5d07c1e56"}, "2084129905632466469": {"text": "ve federal interest (procured under an FTA Award), must be documented to demonstrate acceptance and the responsibility for continuing control of that asset over its useful life.  Since FTA retains an interest in that asset, the recipient agency must document the transfer in a new Award or an Amendment.  The balance of useful life should be referenced, and if the asset is rolling stock, an update to its fleet information in TrAMS and its fleet management/status plan is required.  An Amendment is not required if the asset is transferred after its useful life as defined in the original Award used for the purchase of the asset, or if the Award is not active or closed.  In this case, the recipient of the asset should document the transfer of the federally funded asset and attach the document to the recipient\u2019s profile in TrAMS.  If the recipient is not a current federal recipient, contact your FTA regional or metropolitan office for assistance.  At a minimum, in this situation, an agreement is needed between the\ntwo entities to document acceptance of the transfer of that asset and the continued compliance with the federal requirements that are bound to those assets.  A copy of that document must be transmitted to the FTA Regional or Metropolitan office.\n5. AWARD CLOSEOUT.  Closeout, in general, is the term used to signify the process by which the recipient and FTA agree that all activities approved for the Award have been completed and/or the federal assistance awarded has been expended for eligible costs.  Recipients are required to close an Award 90 days after the end of the period of performance.  FTA, or the recipient, may initiate the closeout process.  Closeout, by either party, does not preclude FTA\u2019s ability to seek repayment or other remedies for a recipient\u2019s breach of the terms and conditions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.   a. Closeout by Recipient.  The recipient is responsible to initiate closeout of the Award, within 90 days after the end of the period of performance, or after all approved activities are completed and/or the applicable federal assistance has been expended for all eligible costs.  Any deviation from the approved Award must be documented in the closeout amendment.  The recipient must initiate the closeout electronically, by submitting the following information in TrAMS, as part of the closeout process:  (1) Confirmation that activities are complete and if closeout Amendment will deobligate any unexpended balance of federal assistance;\n(2) A list of property acquired or improved in support of the Award that will continue to be within the purview of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement;\n(3) A final, reconciled Award Budget reflecting actual Project costs by scope code and activity, reflecting adjustments to the federal and non-federal amounts;\n(4) A final FFR, consistent with the reconciled Award Budget (e.g., deobligation);\n(5) A final narrative MPR indicating the actual completion date of each ALI and a discussion of each ALI contained in the final Award Budget; and\n(6) Any other documentation or reports required as part of the terms and conditions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.\nb. Closeout by FTA.  FTA may unilaterally initiate closeout of the Award.  FTA will contact the recipient, in writing, of its decision to initiate closeout of the Award with the appropriate reasoning included.  Circumstances that could cause FTA to close the Award at any time, include (Note: This list is not exhaustive):  (1) The recipient\u2019s failure to comply with the terms or conditions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement or other federal requirements;\n(2) Continuation of the Award would not produce results commensurate with further expenditure of funds;\n(3) Federal assistance is no longer needed to accomplish the purpose of the Award;\n(4) Failure by the recipient to make reasonable progress to complete activities under the Award for which federal assistance was awarded;\n(5) Failure by the recipient to execute the Award agreement within 90 days of FTA\u2019s Award; or\n(6) FTA\u2019s determination that the project has been essentially completed and the federal assistance awarded has been substantially drawn down.\nc. Adjustments to the Federal Share of Costs.  Necessary adjustments to the federal share of the costs of the Award are made after FTA receives and reviews the required closeout information.  Adjustments may also be necessary after the \u201cSingle Audit\u201d required by 2 CFR part 200 is performed.  Additional information pertaining to the required audit is contained in Chapter VI, \u201cFinancial Management.\u201d  Any federal assistance for the Award received by the recipient but not expended must be returned to FTA.  For more information pertaining to returning federal assistance to FTA, see Chapter VI, \u201cFinancial Management.\u201d\n6. SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION.   a. Suspension.  The suspension of the Award is an action by FTA that temporarily suspends federal assistance for the Award or a specific Project approved for the Award (or more than one Award) pending corrective action by the recipient or pending FTA\u2019s decision to terminate the Award.  If FTA determines that the recipient has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement, including the civil rights requirements, FTA will notify the recipient in writing of its intent to suspend the Award.  FTA may withhold further payments and/or prohibit the recipient from incurring additional obligations pending corrective action by the recipient or a decision to terminate for cause.  This includes work being performed by third-party contractors or consultants.  Unless FTA notifies the recipient otherwise, suspension will not invalidate obligations properly incurred by the recipient before the date of suspension to the extent that those obligations cannot be cancelled.\nb. Termination for Cause.  FTA may terminate the Award, in whole or in part, at any time before completion, whenever it determines that the recipient failed to comply with its conditions including failure to make reasonable progress.  FTA also may terminate the Award when FTA determines that continuing to provide federal assistance to support the Award does not adequately serve the purposes of the law authorizing that Award.  FTA will promptly notify the recipient in writing of its intent to terminate, the reasons therefor, and the effective date of termination.  Payments made to the recipient or recoveries by FTA will be made in accordance with the terms of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement and the legal rights and liabilities of both parties as specified in the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.\nc. Termination for Convenience.  FTA or the recipient may terminate the Award in whole or in part, when both parties agree that continuation of the Award would not produce results commensurate with the further expenditure of federal assistance.  By executing the Award, the recipient agrees at the outset to a termination for convenience in the event FTA makes such a finding.  Both parties must agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portions of the Award to be terminated.  The recipient may not incur new obligations for the terminated portion of the Award after the effective date of the termination and must cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible.  FTA evaluates each obligation to determine its eligibility for inclusion in the costs of the Award.  Settlement is made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  FTA allows full credit to the recipient for the federal share of the obligations (that cannot be cancelled) properly incurred by the recipient before termination.\nd. Partial Termination.  In some cases, FTA may deobligate federal assistance for the Award before closeout because the federal assistance is no longer needed to accomplish the purpose of the Award.\n7. RETENTION AND ACCESS REQUIREMENTS FOR RECORDS.   a. Applicability.  This section applies to all financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and other records of each recipient.  Records retention and access requirements also apply to the recipient\u2019s third-party contractors, third-party subcontractors, and subrecipients.  The recipients must include this requirement in third-party contracts, direct each subrecipient to include these requirements in their subagreements, and also direct its third-party contractors to include these requirements in its third-party subcontracts.  These records are:  (1) Records required to be maintained as identified in this circular; or as outlined in the terms of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement, or otherwise considered pertinent to FTA program requirements.\n(2) Records executed electronically, that may be retained electronically.  However, copies made by microfilming, photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original records, and files must be accessible for possible review, audit, or downloading to paper copy when required.\nb. Length of Retention Period.   (1) Except as otherwise specified, records must be retained for three years from the specific start dates specified in Chapter III, subsection 7.c, below.\n(2) To avoid duplicate record keeping, FTA may make special arrangements with the recipient (including subrecipients, as appropriate) to retain any records that are continually needed for joint use.  FTA will request the transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the records possess long-term retention value.  When the records are transferred to or maintained by FTA, the three-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.\nc. Starting Date of the Retention Period.   (1) General.  In most circumstances, the starting date for retention of records is the date when the recipient submits the final expenditure report to FTA.  For a project that is supported with federal assista", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "bacd035c-1747-4364-8736-40a436e99a0b"}, "8855497606909041406": {"text": "nce across multiple Awards, FTA may request that the starting date for retention of records be the date when the last associated Award is closed.  For example, for a large capital project where a third-party contract is funded across more than one Award, retention of records associated with that third-party contract would commence as soon as the last Award financing that third-party contract is closed.  If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, or other action involving the records has been started before the expiration of the three-year period, the records must be retained for three years after completion of the action and resolution of all issues that arise from it.\n(2) Equipment Records.  The three-year retention period for equipment records starts from the date of the equipment\u2019s disposition, replacement, or transfer at FTA\u2019s direction.\n(3) Records for Income Transactions after Closeout of the Award.  In some cases, the recipient must report income after the Award is closed.  When there is such a requirement, the retention period for the records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of the recipient\u2019s FY in which the income is earned, even if it falls after the date of the closeout of the Award (for example, if closeout occurs on September 5, and the recipient\u2019s FY ends on June 30 of the following year, record retention begins the next day, on July 1).\n(4) Indirect Cost Rate Proposals, Cost Allocation Plans (CAPs) and Similar Rate, and Rate Allocation Methods (including de minimis rate).  This paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals (including de minimis rates), CAPs, and any similar accounting computations or the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage charge back rates or composite fringe benefit rates).   a) If submitted for negotiation.  If the proposal, plan, or other computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the recipient) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the three-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of such submission.\nb) If not submitted for negotiation.  If the proposal, plan, or other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the recipient) for negotiation purposes, then the three-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or computation and its supporting records starts from the end of the FY (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.\n(5) Third-party Contract Records.  The retention period for all third-party contract records required to be retained commences after the recipient(s) makes final payment(s), and all other pending contract matters are closed.   a) Substitution of Photocopies.  Copies of documents may be substituted for the originals.\nb) Access to Records.   1 Records of Recipients and Subrecipients.  FTA, the U.S. DOT Office of Inspector General, and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives, have the right of access to any of the recipient\u2019s books, documents, papers, or other records that pertain to the Award, in order to perform audits, or make examinations, excerpts, or transcripts.\n2 Expiration of Right of Access.  The right of access in this section is not limited to the required retention period but continues as long as the records are retained.\nc) Restrictions on Public Access.  In general, the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, does not apply to any recipient record owned and possessed by the recipient until the recipient provides that record to the Federal Government.  Unless required by state or local law, recipients and subrecipients are not required to provide periodic public access to their records.  However, FTA may request a recipient to provide access to those records the recipient maintains on behalf of FTA, (i.e., records required by federal statute or regulation, such as Davis-Bacon wage records), or other records necessary to determine compliance with federal requirements established as conditions of eligibility for recipients of federal assistance.\nMANAGEMENT OF THE AWARD\n1. GENERAL.  Real property including facilities purchased or constructed under the Award, equipment including rolling stock, and supplies must be managed, used, and disposed of in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  This chapter provides guidance on the acquisition, management, use, and disposition of Federal Transit Administration (FTA) assisted property including facilities purchased or constructed under the Award, equipment including rolling stock, and supplies in accordance with 2 CFR part 200 and other federal requirements.\n2. REAL PROPERTY.  Real property must be acquired, in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (Uniform Act or URA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4601 et seq., and 49 CFR part 24, the implementing regulation.  Real property must be used and managed in accordance with the current Master Agreement and subpart D of 2 CFR part 200, specifically \u00a7\u00a7 200.311, 200.316, 200.329, 200.436, and 200.439.  The following requirements govern the acquisition, use, or disposition of real property purchased with federal assistance.  All regulatory references in this section are to 49 CFR part 24, unless specified otherwise. a. General.  If a recipient is using FTA funding, including local share funds, to acquire real property or provide relocation assistance necessary to secure property for the Award, the recipient must comply with the requirements in the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (Uniform Act or URA), as amended.  The Uniform Act is implemented by regulation, 49 CFR part 24.\nThe objective of the Uniform Act is to ensure equitable treatment of property owners of real property to be acquired under the federally-assisted Award; that people displaced by a federally assisted Award be treated fairly, consistently, and equitably; and that acquiring agencies implement the regulations in a manner that is efficient and cost effective.  The regulations implementing the Uniform Act are very specific in naming the means to achieve those legislated objectives.\nFTA must review and concur in appraisals and review appraisals for acquisitions and dispositions of more than $1,000,000 or in-kind contributions and land exchanges of any value before federal assistance is expended, or the value is used as non-federal share.  A review appraiser\u2019s report is required on all appraisals receiving federal assistance.  Federal assistance may be awarded before the appraisal is completed; however, the amount of the in-kind contribution cannot be determined and applied to the Award until the appraisal has been approved by FTA.  The requirements and processes for conducting appraisals, review appraisals, providing relocation assistance, and requesting FTA\u2019s concurrence are described as follows:\n(1) Unless otherwise agreed to by FTA in writing, to ensure eligibility for federal assistance, the recipient should follow the typical process sequence when acquiring real property under an Award.\nRecipients should not purchase property (or make a binding offer to purchase it) before completing NEPA, unless the provisions under 771.113(d) or FTA\u2019s Corridor Preservation guidance apply.\nHowever, recipients may engage in preliminary activities to complete the NEPA process provided they do not limit future NEPA considerations or violate the requirements of the Uniform Act.  These preliminary activities may include relocation planning and preliminary discussions with property owners that do not result in binding agreements.  If a recipient chooses to engage in any preliminary negotiations, its staff should prepare a statement for the owner\u2019s signature indicating that the owner understands these discussions to be preliminary and non-binding as to price and other consideration.  Failure to comply with this requirement may jeopardize the eligibility of the Award.\n(2) If a Recipient is considering leasing real property and facilities, discussed in this paragraph, or equipment (except for rolling stock or related equipment), discussed in subsection 4.l of this Chapter, rather than outright purchase of the same, and such lease is a capital not an operating lease, then the recipient must comply with 49 CFR part 639 \u201cCapital Leases\u201d except for provisions pertaining to cost effectiveness.\nb. Appraisal of Real Estate. (1) General.  An offer of just compensation must be established on the basis of recent independently prepared appraisal documents that estimate the fair market value.\n(2) Appraisers.  Appraisers must be certified or licensed with a State Appraisal Board as required by 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103(d)(2).  However, staff employees may be exempt from this requirement.  FTA recommends that appraisals and review appraisals be completed by appraisers experienced with state and federal laws for valuing properties for public acquisitions under the threat of eminent domain.  Appraisers and recipients making appraisal assignments should be familiar with the implementing regulations of the Uniform Act, 49 CFR part 24, especially subpart B\u2014Real Property Acquisition.  State subrecipients may use the state\u2019s staff appraisers to prepare required independent appraisals and appraisal reviews.\n(3) Requirements.  Appraisals must be fully compliant with all of the appraisal requirements as cited in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103(a).  This includes compliance with the Scope of Work (SOW) (reference Appendix D to this Circular), i.e., defining the appraisal requirements and, as appropriate, a realty/personalty report.  The appraisal SOW sets out the specifications for the appraisal of a specific parcel or grouping thereof.  It can be included in or appended to the contract wit", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "e6ff43de-3bae-4a90-be53-8af871f73a89"}, "5591360900818443977": {"text": "h a fee appraiser or the assignment to an agency staff appraiser.  The appraiser will also\nappropriately address the requirements of 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103(b) and (c) in the report concerning the effects of influence of the Award and owner retention of improvements.\nDepending on the individual State Appraisal Board, certified/licensed appraisers may need to utilize the jurisdictional exception provisions of Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) in order to complete the assignment for a public agency in full compliance with the requirements of 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103.\nIf the acquisition leaves the owner with an uneconomic remnant, the appraiser or review appraiser may be assigned the responsibility to make this determination and appraise the fair market value of the remnant.  See 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(k).\nThe owner also has a right to accompany the appraiser during the inspection of the property pursuant to 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(c)(1).\nWhen valuing properties that contain contamination or hazardous material, the appraiser must consider the effect, if any, the contamination\u2019s or material\u2019s presence has on the market value.  Recipients shall ensure that all Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) research results undertaken during the NEPA process are provided to the appraiser at the start of the valuation process.\nThe appraisal of property with contamination is a complex subject and is more fully covered in the discussion of the appraisal Scope of Work found in Appendix D.  Recipients should update appraisals over six months old in an active real estate market before fair market value is determined and submit to the FTA regional or Metropolitan office for review and concurrence, when required.  If the documents are not updated, the letter of transmittal to FTA shall provide adequate justification explaining why the appraisal was not updated.\n(4) Exceptions.  Full appraisal and/or negotiation procedures are not necessary in certain instances.  While an appraisal of the property may not be required in some of the following instances, the recipient must have some reasonable basis for its determination of fair market value in accordance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.101(b) and the related requirements to this section in 49 CFR part 24, Appendix A.  In the case of a donation, an appraisal may not be required; however, an appraisal is required if the recipient proposes to use the property as an in-kind contribution as part of the non-federal share.  State subrecipients may use the state\u2019s staff appraisers to prepare required independent appraisals.  FTA should be contacted for further guidance when any one of the following situations occurs: a) The owner is donating the property, reference 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 24.108 and 24.102(c)(2);\nb) The recipient does not have authority to acquire property by eminent domain as set out in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.101(b);\nc) The property qualifies as a voluntary acquisition as described in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.101(b); or\nd) The valuation is uncomplicated, and the fair market value is estimated at $10,000 or less, based on a review of available data, using the waiver valuation provision found at 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 24.102(c)(2) and 24.2(a)(33).\n(5) Exceptional Circumstances.  Recipients may request FTA review and approval to use other reasonable valuation methods for determining the remaining property valuation and federal interest at the time of the disposition request.  Other valuation methods could include accelerated depreciation, comparable sales, or established market values.  In its review of such a request, FTA may consider any action taken, omission made, or unfortunate occurrence the recipient suffered.\nc. Appraisal Review of Real Estate. (1) General.  All appraisals for acquisition of real property are to be reviewed in accordance with the Uniform Act and 49 CFR \u00a7 24.104.  The review appraisal should determine the soundness of the report\u2019s value estimate.  A qualified review appraiser (See 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103(d)(1), 49 CFR part 24, Appendix A, and 49 CFR \u00a7 24.104) shall examine the presentation and analysis of market information in all appraisals to assure that they meet the definition of an appraisal found in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.2(a)(3), as well as other appraisal requirements found in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103 and other applicable state and local requirements.  FTA requires that the review appraiser\u2019s comments be in a narrative format.  The review appraiser may use an appraisal checklist provided that it is supported by a narrative explanation of the key points of the appraisal.\nThe review appraiser is often expected to determine whether the value conclusion is consistent with state laws pertaining to what is compensable in eminent domain for public acquisitions and with the Uniform Act.  The review appraiser is also responsible for assuring that value estimates are consistent when multiple parcels of property are needed for the Award.  The review appraiser cannot determine the soundness of a report\u2019s value estimate without possessing familiarity with the subject property, the comparable sales used, and other market factors; thus rarely will only a desk review be sufficient.  The appraisal review report is expected to be a technical analysis of the appraisal, not merely an administrative review.\n(2) Requirements.  In accordance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.104(a), the review appraiser shall prepare a written report identifying each appraisal report as: a) Recommended (as the basis for the establishment of the amount believed to be just compensation);\nb) Accepted (meets all requirements, but not selected as recommended or approved); or\nc) Not accepted.\n(3) Establishment of Just Compensation.  If authorized by the recipient, a staff review appraiser may also establish the approved appraisal amount as the offer of just compensation.  Under no circumstances can the establishment of the just compensation amount be delegated to a contractor (i.e., a fee review appraiser) who is not a governmental official of the agency.\nIf the review appraiser is unable to recommend (or approve) an appraisal as an adequate basis for the establishment of the offer of just compensation, and it is determined by the acquiring agency that it is not practical to obtain an additional appraisal, the review appraiser may, as part of the review, present and analyze market information in conformance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103 to support a recommended (or approved) value (See 49 CFR part 24, Appendix A, related to 49 CFR \u00a7 24.104(b)).\nReview appraisers who are not staff employees must be state certified appraisers.\nd. Appraisal Concurrence Requirement.\nFTA concurrence is required for both appraisals and the appraisal reviews when:\n(1) For intended parcel acquisition and disposition, the valuation is greater than $1,000,000;\n(2) For non-federal contribution, whether in cash or in-kind contributions, and land exchange of any value; or\n(3) For property condemnations exceeding $1,000,000.\nNote: All appraisals regardless of value must be compliant with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103.  FTA may choose to review any appraisal or review appraisal used in an FTA assisted Award when circumstances warrant or as part of a periodic review.  The recipient must maintain documentation that supports valuation decisions in the parcel files.\ne. Acquisition of Real Estate and Concurrence Requirements.  In accordance with URA requirements every effort should be made to acquire real property by negotiation based on the approved just compensation amount that has been determined by the acquiring agency and considering the requirements described below: (1) Market Value.  Before making an offer to the property owner, the recipient must first establish market value of the parcel to be purchased.  Property acquisition activities will be conducted in compliance with the requirements of 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 24.101 and 24.102.  Market value is to be established through a current appraisal and appraisal review accomplished in accordance with the requirements of 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 24.103 and 24.104, respectively.  Once the appraisal and the appraisal review are complete, a determination of just compensation must be made by the recipient in accordance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(d).\n(2) Making an Offer.  After the just compensation determination has been made by the agency, with FTA concurrence, if required, an offer can be made to the owner.\nNo owner shall be required to surrender possession of real property without either payment of the agreed purchase price to the owner or deposit of the established just compensation amount in a condemnation court as set out in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(j).  The full amount of the deposit must be made available to the owner without prejudice pending the ultimate determination of just compensation by the judicial process.  The recipient must expeditiously reimburse property owners for actual, reasonable, and necessary expenses incidental to transfer of title pursuant to 49 CFR \u00a7 24.106.\n(3) Uneconomic remnant.  If the acquisition leaves the owner with an uneconomic remnant, the recipient must offer to acquire that remnant, and its value will be presented as an element of the written offer that is made (See 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(k)).\n(4) Filing Condemnation.  Additionally, FTA concurrence is required before filing for condemnation, if the appraised amount exceeds $1,000,000.\n(5) Administrative Settlements.  Any settlement in excess of the recipient\u2019s approved just compensation must be addressed as an administrative settlement (See definition, Chapter I, subsection 5.c. of this Circular) and 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(i).  The term \u201cadministrative settlements\u201d encompasses both negotiated settlements and legal settlements.  Legal settlements are those arrived at prior to a trial on the merits. a) Requirements.  Administrative settlements in excess of $50,000 of the current fair market value require prior FTA concurrence.  Note that relocation payments are not considered part of an administrative settlement.  Instead of using its power of eminent domain when a property cannot", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "3f47a359-21e2-4d1c-a51a-66e28aa440f2"}, "6708403941170919823": {"text": " be purchased at appraised value, a recipient may propose acquisition through negotiated settlement, as explained previously in Chapter IV, paragraph 2.e.(5) of this Circular.  The recipient must document that reasonable efforts to purchase the property at the appraised amount have failed and prepare a written justification supporting why the settlement is reasonable, prudent, and in the public interest.  Such a settlement will be handled in accordance with administrative settlement requirements at 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(i).  If the settlement request represents a significant increase in excess of $50,000 of the just compensation and if trial risks are a key factor in the settlement justification, a litigation attorney for the recipient must be consulted and provide a signed letter of concurrence in the settlement.  The decision to recommend a settlement should evaluate among other relevant matters, the risks of settling for the proposed amount versus the risks of conducting a condemnation trial in court.\nb) Settlement Concurrence Requirement.  All settlements must be justified in writing and be available in the files pertaining to the Award.  The justification\nshall be thorough, document the entire settlement process, demonstrate the logic and reason supporting the settlement, and be able to withstand the scrutiny of an independent review.  If either type of settlement exceeds FTA\u2019s threshold for approval, it must be submitted to FTA for advance concurrence before the settlement is consummated.\nf. Relocation Assistance.  The relocation assistance program provides a variety of advisory services and benefits to displaced people, businesses, and nonprofit organizations.  The highlights of this program element and FTA policies related to it are summarized in the following: (1) Early provision of written notices and explanations of federal acquisition and relocation programs must be provided to displacees as required by 49 CFR part 24.\n(2) No lawful occupant will be required to move without at least 90 days\u2019 advance notice per 49 CFR \u00a7 24.203(c).\n(3) In the case of residential displacees, at least one comparable replacement dwelling must be made available before the displacees must move.  Rental assistance and replacement housing payments are provided to make the dwellings affordable and available at the time the notice is given.  See 49 CFR \u00a7 24.204.\n(4) All displacees, both business and residential, are reimbursed for certain moving expenses per 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 24.301 through 24.306.\n(5) There must be as many residential dwellings available as there are families who will be displaced.  The dwellings must be comparable to the ones from which the people are displaced.  In addition, the comparable replacement dwellings must be decent, safe, and sanitary (DSS); located in the same area or in areas generally not less desirable in regard to public utilities and public and commercial facilities; reasonably accessible to the displacees\u2019 places of employment and within the financial means of the displaced families; and adequate in size to accommodate the occupants in accordance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.204. a) The definition of DSS at 49 CFR \u00a7 24.2(a)(8) contains the following requirements regarding the number of rooms and area of living space for the displacees.  \u201cThe number of persons occupying each habitable room used for sleeping purposes shall not exceed that permitted by local housing codes or, in the absence of local codes, the policies of the displacing Agency.  In addition, the displacing Agency shall follow the requirements for separate bedrooms for children of the opposite gender included in local housing codes or in the absence of local codes, the policies of such agencies.\u201d\nb) In the absence of applicable housing codes, FTA\u2019s policy requires separate bedrooms and gender separation for children over 12 years of age.\n(6) Replacement housing must be open to all people regardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin as required by 49 CFR \u00a7 24.8 of the URA regulations.\n(7) Any relocation benefits required by state or local law exceeding the specified limits in the Uniform Act will not be reimbursed by FTA.\n(8) Any global type settlements of a property acquisition that involve the inclusion of relocation payments based on other than relocation costs that are actual, reasonable, and necessary are not eligible for FTA reimbursement in accordance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.207(e) of the URA regulations.\n(9) Rental and for-sale dwellings used in the determination of replacement housing benefits must be actually and currently available for sale or rent.  FTA does not allow the use of rent schedules for the calculation of rental housing cost differentials as it is not compliant with the URA regulations that require that comparable and currently available rental properties be identified and provided to the displacees.\ng. Special Real Estate Acquisition Program Strategies/Issues.  Several real estate program strategies or issues are worthy of discussion in some detail as follows: (1) Alternative Procedure.  A recipient with a qualified and fully staffed real estate department conducting a major capital project within an FTA assisted Award may request an alternative process, which permits higher dollar thresholds before FTA prior concurrence is needed.\nRecipients may request a review through the FTA Regional Office.  An FTA real estate specialist will review the acquisition process and the recipient\u2019s capabilities.\nThe request for the approval for alternative real property procedures at a minimum should include the following:\na) A statement providing an overall justification and reasoning for why the alternative procedure is requested;\nb) A copy of real estate department operating procedures;\nc) A real estate department organization staffing chart;\nd) A strategy for using and qualifying real estate services contractors, if used;\ne) An estimate of the number of transactions that may exceed requested threshold(s);\nf) A discussion of real estate acquisition schedule/status relative to the overall schedule for the Award; and\ng) A discussion of real estate department program quality assurance/quality control procedures that are in place to assure program delivery is in compliance with Uniform Act requirements and effective/efficient operational standards given the higher thresholds requested.\n(2) In-Kind Contributions.  Recipients may use in-kind contributions of real property as part of the non-federal share so long as the property to be donated is needed to carry out the scope of work of the Award.  Contributions of real property as non-federal share, either owned and contributed by the recipient or by a third party to the recipient, must meet the following criteria:  a) Are verifiable from the recipient\u2019s records;\nb) Are not included as contributions for any other Award;\nc) Are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of the objectives of the Award;\nd) Are allowable under the Federal Cost Principles;\ne) Are not paid for by the Federal Government under another federal Award; except where an applicable federal statute specifically allows such payment; and\nf) Are provided for in the Award Budget.\nThe property can be owned and donated by the recipient or by a third party.  The in-kind contribution allowance will be based on the current market value as independently appraised.  Appraisals and review appraisals for property being donated, regardless of appraised value, must be submitted to the FTA regional or metropolitan office for concurrence.  The value of the donated property may not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.\nCredit can only be allowed for the value of the portion of real property used or consumed by the project.  If part of a larger parcel is to be used as non-federal share and the remaining sub-parcel is intended to be used at a future date for future share, the recipient is cautioned to clearly indicate the limits of the sub-parcel to be used as non-federal share and the appraised amount associated with the sub-parcel.  The remnant sub-parcel can then follow the same procedure for future non-federal share.  If the entire parcel is provided as non-federal share and no delineation is made related to possible use of the excess sub-parcel as over-match, eligibility of the over-match sub-parcel may be lost.  If federal assistance were used to purchase the property, only the non-federal share of such property may be counted as the value of the in-kind contribution.\n(3) Land Exchanges.  Some recipients find that during the development of the Award, better uses of federally assisted property can be achieved by exchanging parts or parcels with neighboring property owners, sometimes called a land swap or land exchange.  FTA does not have a separate process for these transactions; instead, this action is accomplished through determining the current fair market value, by appraisal, of the property to be acquired and the property to be disposed by the recipient.  Since the land exchange process is in lieu of a typical acquisition, all of the Uniform Act requirements are applicable.  If the Award is still open, and the\npart to be disposed is more valuable than the part acquired, the net proceeds must be credited to the open Award.  If the Award is closed, or not yet developed, the recipient should follow other disposition methods defined in this chapter.\n(4) Joint Development.  Please refer to the most recent edition of FTA Circular 7050.1, \u201cFederal Transit Administration Guidance on Joint Development,\u201d for further information if seeking to pursue a joint development with federally assisted property.\n(5) Functional Replacement.  Functional replacement provides a method of paying the cost necessary to replace a publicly owned facility (i.e., a fire station or public school) being acquired with a similar needed facility.  The FTA regional or metropolitan office should be contacted for further information.\n", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "c153304d-b65c-4b87-90da-5a76a6642101"}, "7247640558075510251": {"text": "A determination to use functional replacement should be made early in the development process for the project(s) under the Award.  The use of this approach would usually be addressed during the environmental review phase preceding the Award and be presented as a mitigation measure to be undertaken under the Award.\n(6) Contaminated Property (including Brownfields as defined in Chapter 1 of this Circular).\nAs part of the NEPA process, the recipient must undertake appropriate due diligence to identify the risks associated with acquiring property that may be contaminated.  For all real estate acquisitions, the recipient must undertake a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) to assess the environmental condition of the property and identify actual or potential areas where contaminants may have been released to the environment.  If the results of the Phase I ESA indicate that the property is likely contaminated, the recipient shall undertake, as appropriate, additional Phase II and III ESAs to confirm the presence of contaminations and quantify the cost to remediate based on the intended use of the property for the federally assisted capital transit Award.  For those projects in which FTA issues a NEPA determination with detailed documentation, all necessary remediation commitments based on the results and recommendations of the ESA(s), including commitments to engage in further evaluations if the site access was restricted, will be included in FTA\u2019s NEPA determination.  For NEPA determinations without detailed documentation, any such remediation commitments must be included in the file for the Award and in the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  When acquiring contaminated properties, the recipient, as project sponsor, should collect as much information as possible regarding the levels of contamination on the desired site and determine an appropriate approach for remediation prior to the completion of NEPA.\nThe results of the Phase I, II, and III ESAs, where available, and other site-specific documentation prepared by the recipient must be provided to the real estate appraiser for consideration of the effect, if any, contamination has on the highest and best use (HBU) and the market value of the property, including what is\ncommonly referred to in many states as a market condition known as \u201cstigma,\u201d in accordance with state law.\nThe valuation analysis of a contaminated property involves a complex economic and environmental analysis from the standpoint of HBU that requires the careful preparation of an appraisal Scope of Work that appropriately addresses the appraisal problem as provided in Appendix D.  Due to the complexity of appraisals involving contaminated property, it is suggested you contact your FTA Regional Office for legal and technical assistance as early as possible.\nAn FTA environmental determination (FEIS/ROD, ROD, FONSI, or CE) should be obtained before any offer to purchase or other commitment is made to purchase the property or to proceed to a settlement.  Further, ESA Phases I, II, and III may be required including estimated remediation costs before a reliable real estate appraisal of the value of the property can be completed.  Such information may be required by the appraiser to determine the cost of any remediation required for the HBU or other uses, including the use anticipated for the capital transit Award.  It may be necessary to obtain a right of entry (ROE) or other preliminary property interest to do appropriate site assessments, if available.\nSince it may be difficult for a recipient to undertake a Phase II ESA prior to land acquisition since such a study is intrusive and requires access to the site and actual physical samples to be collected, the recipient shall consider the following limitations prior to acquiring contaminated properties:\na) The legal responsibility for hazardous material cleanup and disposal rests with parties within the property title chain and with parties responsible for the placement of the material on the property.  Recipients must attempt to identify and seek legal recourse from those potentially responsible parties or substantiate the basis for not seeking reimbursement for FTA review and consideration.\nb) The estimated cost to remediate the contamination may result in a total cost of the Award that exceeds the recipient\u2019s ability to fully finance it without significant risk to the project.  If the recipient and FTA determine that the recipient does not have sufficient funds to proceed with the Award, the recipient shall seek an alternate site for the Award.  Any FTA assistance provided to the recipient to purchase property that is subsequently abandoned shall be either returned to FTA or credited against a future property acquisition.\nc) FTA generally will not participate in the remediation of contamination discovered during construction, except where it has been demonstrated that appropriate environmental studies were performed, the results communicated to the appraiser prior to the appraisal, and the recommendations followed.\nThere are two exceptions to this policy as follows:\n1 The brownfield site was previously utilized for transportation use, and the recipient or transit agency is legally responsible for all cleanup activity; or\n2 Seeking and obtaining compensation from potentially responsible parties would involve excessive litigation and delay in completing the Award, the cost of which would likely exceed the remediation cost, and which would be contrary to the public interest.\nFTA also recognizes that the recipient may not be able to quantify the extent of contamination or cost to remediate the property until the recipient obtains access to the site to conduct a Phase II or possibly Phase III ESA.  In these instances, FTA will work with the recipient to develop a process for estimating the total cost of the Award, including cleanup, to ascertain whether or not the Award should continue as planned given the site conditions.  FTA will consider what assurances the recipient can provide to minimize the risks associated with developing a contaminated site prior to approving an Award for construction activities.  Where the risks are deemed too great for the Award to bear, FTA will instruct the recipient to locate an alternate site to support the Award.\nd) Refer to Appendix D, \u201cGuide for Preparing an Appraisal Scope of Work\u201d for a discussion of the valuation of contaminated property.\ne) The recipient should contact FTA for technical assistance regarding contaminated property.\nh. Real Estate Acquisition Management Plan (RAMP).  FTA requires a RAMP for each major capital project within an Award as a part of the Project Management Plan (PMP) under 49 CFR \u00a7 633.25 and the Relocation Plan in accordance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.205.  A RAMP is not required for other capital projects within an Award with real estate acquisition; however, all capital projects must be in compliance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.205, if real estate acquisition or relocation assistance is involved.  The RAMP is a planning document for the acquiring agency and is a control document for FTA that includes real estate goals and methodology from the perspective of timing, staffing, statutory, and policy issues.\nThe RAMP should be periodically reviewed by the recipient for needed changes.  A written relocation plan should be a part of the RAMP if there are anticipated displacements of residential occupants or businesses.  The extent of the relocation plan should be commensurate with the complexity and volume of displacements.\nThe RAMP must clearly detail how the needed real estate for the Award will be acquired.  See Appendix C of this circular for a model in the development of a RAMP.\ni. Property Management.  This area concerns the post-construction management of property acquired for the facility during development to ensure that it is properly maintained and operated efficiently for the benefit of the transit system. (1) Title to Real Property is vested in the recipient or other public bodies.  The recipient agrees to include a covenant in the title of the real property acquired for use under the Award that assures non-discrimination during the useful life of the property.\n(2) Use.  Real property must be used for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose.  Recipients must not dispose of, modify the use of, or encumber its title or other interests in the federally assisted site and facilities without prior FTA written approval.  Recipients are required to use federally assisted property continuously and appropriately throughout the useful life of the property.  Recipients may be required to return the entire amount of federal assistance spent on the Award or federally assisted property thereunder if, during the useful life, the recipient has unreasonably delayed or failed to use the federally assisted property for its originally intended purpose.  Recipients are also required to notify FTA before property is removed from the service originally intended at the time of approval of the Award and if property is put to additional or substitute uses.\n(3) Maintenance.  Real property must be appropriately maintained.  A description of the improvements, expansions, retrofits, and maintenance of real property must be properly documented in the facility inventory along with parcel address or location, useful life, date placed in service, original acquisition cost and federal percentage of cost in order to accurately determine an equitable valuation of federal interest at the time of early disposition of the asset.\n(4) Idle Facilities and Idle Capacity.   a) Idle facility means completely unused facilities that are excess to the recipient\u2019s current needs.  Idle capacity means the unused capacity of partially used facilities.  Idle capacity is the difference between that which a facility could achieve under 100 percent operating time, on a one-shift basis, less operating interruptions resulting", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "0579bea4-b0ca-4834-ac10-41b94da910b5"}, "2847426543560901750": {"text": " from time lost for repairs, setups, unsatisfactory materials, and other normal delays and the extent to which the facility was actually used to meet demands during the accounting period.\nb) Costs of Idle Facilities or Idle Capacity.  Cost of idle facilities or idle capacity means costs such as maintenance, repair, housing, rent, and other related costs including insurance and depreciation.  The costs of idle facilities are unallowable except to the extent that they are necessary to meet workload requirements which may fluctuate and are allocated appropriately to all programs or it can be shown that the costs were necessary when acquired and are now idle because of changes in program requirements, efforts to achieve more economical operations, reorganization, termination or other causes which could not have been reasonably foreseen.  Under the exception previously stated, costs of idle facilities are allowable for a reasonable period of time, ordinarily not to exceed one year, depending on the initiative taken to use, lease, or dispose of the facilities and the justification provided by the recipient for FTA review and approval.\n(5) Reporting on Real Property. Recipients must maintain adequate records on the status of real property in which the Federal Government retains an interest.  FTA requires that recipients maintain a real property inventory on file for review upon request by FTA to satisfy the requirements of 2 CFR \u00a7 200.329, which requires recipients to submit reports on an annual basis for real property in which the Federal Government retains an interest.  In instances where the federal interest in the real property will extend for a period of 15 years or more, a recipient may request FTA\u2019s permission to report at multi-year frequencies, not to exceed a five-year reporting period.\nA Real Property Inventory must include: property location/physical address; use and condition of the property; summary of conditions on the title; brief description of improvements, expansions, and retrofits; corresponding useful life for the assets; date placed in service; original acquisition cost; sources of funding; federal and non-federal participation ratios; federal award identification number; appraised value and date; anticipated disposition or action proposed; date of disposal; and sale price of the property.  If the property is excess, identify the reasons for having excess property, such as purchase to a logical boundary.  This inventory is necessary in order to accurately account for assets, and determine an equitable valuation of federal interest retained in the property.\nThe Excess Real Property Inventory and Utilization Plan requirement applies only to Grants or Cooperative Agreements awarded before December 26, 2014.\nThe Real Property Reporting requirement (Real Property Inventory) replaces the Excess Real Property Inventory and Utilization Plan requirement for Grants and Cooperative Agreements (and funding increments to existing Grants and Cooperative Agreements) awarded on or after December 26, 2014.\n(6) Non-Transit Uses of FTA Assisted Real Property.  FTA\u2019s policy is to permit recipients maximum flexibility in determining the best and most cost-effective use of federally-assisted property.  To this end, FTA encourages non-transit uses of real property that can raise additional revenues for the transit system or, at a reasonable cost, enhance system ridership.  These non-transit uses are by one of three means: incidental use, joint development, or shared use.   a) Incidental Use.  Incidental uses must be compatible with the approved purposes of the Award and may not interfere with either the intended uses of the property or the recipient\u2019s ability to maintain satisfactory continuing control.  The recipient should consult with FTA before continuing with incidental use.  An incidental use may not affect a property\u2019s transit capacity or use.  Alterations to accommodate an incidental use should have no negative impact on the transit service or activity.  FTA continues to monitor the incidental use after the Award is closed and the recipient is required to keep an inventory of the use.  FTA reviews the inventory during the triennial review process.   1 Examples of incidental use include:  a Temporary use of transit property as a staging area for nearby construction;\nb Allowing nearby theaters and restaurants to use transit parking spaces during the transit system\u2019s off-hours;\nc Leasing of space in a station for a newspaper stand or coffee shop when the additional use does not interfere with the original purpose authorized in the Award; and\nd The lease of air rights over transit facilities or utilities associated with transit facilities (such as spare capacity in general utilities and fiber optics communications utilities) that do not impact the structural configuration of the transit facility.\n2 Revocation.  An incidental use agreement should permit revocation by the recipient.\n3 Limits.  The recipient agrees that any incidental use of federally assisted property will not exceed that permitted under applicable federal requirements and federal guidance.  The recipient may permit non-transit public entities and private entities to have incidental use of its federally assisted facilities and equipment, including alternative fueling facilities and associated equipment, subject to the following considerations:  a Needed Property.  This policy applies only to property that continues to be needed and used for an FTA Award.  It is FTA\u2019s intention to assist only in the purchase of property that is needed for an FTA Award.\nb Purpose & Activity.  The use must not compromise the safe conduct of the intended purpose and activity of the initial public transit activity under the Award.\nc Continuing Control.  The use must not in any way interfere with the recipient\u2019s continuing control over the use of the property or the recipient\u2019s continued ability to carry out the Award.\nd No-Income Use.  While FTA is particularly interested in encouraging incidental use as a means of supplementing transit revenues, no-income uses are also permitted under certain circumstances,\nFor example, a no-income use could include a private, for-profit transit operator offered queue space, or loading space, at an intermodal facility for the purpose of generating rides, providing a\nconsolidated transit option for the public, and a seamless transit transfer opportunity at no cost.\nThe no-income use shows that the value of having the private operator:\n1) benefits transit, as a whole;\n2) expands upon the local transportation alternatives; and\n3) allows the public to transfer seamlessly.     e Income.  Proceeds from incidental use including licensing and leasing of air rights or leasing of other real property interest should be based on competitive market rents and rates of return based on the appraised fair market value.  Income received from the authorized incidental uses including the use of air rights may be retained by the recipients (without returning the federal share) if the income is used for eligible transit capital, or operating expenses.  This income cannot be used as part of the non-federal share of the Award from which it was derived.  However, it may be used as part of the non-federal share of another FTA Award.\nf Recapture.  The recipient should recapture all the costs related to the incidental use from the non-transit public entity or private entity, including all applicable excise taxes on fuel for fueling facilities and wear and tear to capital improvements, unless FTA approves otherwise.\nb) Joint Development.  A joint development project is a transit capital project that integrally relates to, and often co-locates with commercial, residential, mixed-use or other non-transit development within an Award.  Joint development may include partnerships for public or private development associated with any mode of the transit system that is being improved through new construction, renovation, or extension.  Joint development may also include intermodal facilities, intercity bus and rail facilities, transit malls, or historic transportation facilities.  A joint development project, awarded with FTA federal assistance, must satisfy the four eligibility criteria of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5302(3)(G).  See the most recent edition of FTA Circular 7050.1, \u201cGuidance on Joint Development\u201d for further information or guidance.\nc)  Shared Use.  Shared use takes place when a non-transit partner, separate from the recipient, occupies a part of a facility and pays its pro rata share of the construction, maintenance, and operation costs.  Shared uses must be declared at the time of Award.  Shared use of property requires prior written FTA approval except when it involves coordinated public transit human services transportation.  Shared use Awards should be clearly identified and sufficient detail provided to FTA at the time of review to determine allocable costs related to non-transit use for construction, as well as on-going\nmaintenance, and operation costs.  The shared use description of the Award and the definition of the partner participating in the Award must be clearly identified before approval of the Award.\nThe recipient must ensure satisfactory continuing control over the transit portion of the property.\nExamples of shared use projects under an Award include:\n1 A vehicle maintenance facility that services both transit rolling stock and non-transit vehicles;\n2 A parking garage that provides parking for transit rolling stock as well as parking for non-transit uses; and\n3 A parking garage that is constructed to provide parking for both transit patrons and the general public or for a specific business purpose.\nj. Real Estate Disposition. (1) Real Property Reporting Requirements, for Grants or Cooperative Agreements awarded after December 26, 2014.  The Recipient shall prepare and keep up to date the real property inventory for all property that is no longer needed ", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "930f132b-c1e0-437d-b4bd-9230c684483d"}, "5061005410280001089": {"text": "to carry out any transit purpose.  The inventory list should include such things as the property location, a summary of any conditions on the title, the original acquisition cost, the federal participation ratio, the federal Award identification number, the appraised value and date, a brief description of improvements, the current use of the property, and the anticipated disposition or action proposed.\nRecipients are also required to notify FTA when property is removed from the service originally intended when an Award is made and if property is put to additional or substitute uses.  The recipient\u2019s plan should identify and explain the reason for the excess property.  Such reasons may include one or more of the following:\na) The parcel, when purchased, exceeded the recipient\u2019s need (uneconomic remnant, purchased to logical boundary, part of administrative settlement, etc.);\nb) The property was purchased for construction staging purposes such as access, storage or underpinning, and construction is completed;\nc) The intended use of the parcel is no longer possible because of system changes, such as alignment, or amendments to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement for the Award;\nd) Improvements to real property were damaged or destroyed, and therefore the property is not being used for purposes of the Award, but it is still needed for\nthe Award.  If so, the improvements may be renovated or replaced.  In this case, applicable cost principles must be observed; and/or\ne) A portion of the parcel remains unused, will not be used for purposes of the Award in the foreseeable future, and can be sold or otherwise disposed.\nUnless FTA and the recipient agree otherwise, the real property inventory is to be retained by the recipient, available for review upon FTA request, and available for review during the triennial review process.\n(2) Disposition.  If the recipient determines that real property is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was acquired, FTA may approve the use of the property for other purposes.   a) Valuation of Property Pending Disposal.  For properties no longer needed for transit purposes, the recipient is expected to follow the valuation requirements of 49 CFR part 24 and obtain an appraisal and appraisal review to ascertain the value of the property considered for disposal.  Appraisals developed for disposition purposes are required to appraise the value of the land separate from the value of the improvements and these two values must be submitted in the report.  FTA\u2019s determination of the remaining federal interest in the federally assisted property, that have been removed from service before the end of the useful life of the improvements is determined by comparing the fair market value of the entire property with the value of the land plus the depreciated value of the improvements on the land and taking the greater of these two values as the remaining federal interest in the property.\nFTA recognizes that exceptional circumstances may require the recipient to utilize another method of valuation to determine the fair market value of real property that is withdrawn from service.  Under unusual circumstances, the recipient may request permission to use another reasonable valuation method including, but not limited to accelerated depreciation, comparable sales, or established market values.\nApproval of an exceptional circumstance will necessitate FTA consideration of the action the recipient took, any omission the recipient made, or any unfortunate occurrence the recipient suffered.\nFor those situations where the existing improvements do not contribute to the highest and best use of the site valuation, recipients should use an accounting approach to ascertain the remaining economic life and value of the improvements rather than an appraisal valuation approach.  Contact the FTA Regional or Metropolitan office for further information.\nb) Disposition Methods.  When real property is no longer needed for any transit purpose, the recipient will request disposition instructions from FTA.  The allowable disposition methods are as follows: 1 Sell and Reimburse FTA.  Competitively market and sell the property and pay FTA the greater of its share of the fair market value of the property or the straight line depreciated value of the improvements plus land value.  FTA\u2019s share of the fair market value is the percentage of FTA participation in the original Award multiplied by the best obtainable price, minus reasonable sales costs.  If the property has never been used for the appropriate purposes of the Award, the recipient shall sell the property and pay FTA the greater of FTA\u2019s share of the fair market value or the entire amount of federal assistance spent on that property.\n2 Offset.  Sell the property and apply the net proceeds from the sale to the cost of replacement property under the same program.  Return any excess proceeds to FTA in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.311.\n3 Sell and Use Proceeds for Other Capital Projects Under an Award.  Sell the property and use the proceeds to reduce the gross cost of another FTA eligible capital transit project under an Award.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(h)(4).  The recipient is expected to record the receipt of the proceeds in the recipient\u2019s accounting system, showing that the funds are restricted for use in a subsequent capital project, and reduce the amount of those restricted funds as those proceeds are applied to one or more FTA approved capital projects under Awards.  FTA must approve the application of the proceeds to a subsequent capital Award, which should clearly show that the gross cost of the Award has been reduced with proceeds from the earlier transaction.  Examples of future FTA eligible capital transit projects include: the acquisition of buses, facilities and equipment.\n4 Sell and Keep Proceeds in an Open Award.  If the Award is still open, the recipient may sell the excess property and apply the proceeds to the original cost of the total real property purchased for that Award.  This may reduce the federal share of the Award.\n5 Transfer to Public Agency for Non-Transit Use.  Follow procedures for publication in the Federal Register to transfer property (land or equipment) to a public agency with no repayment to FTA.  This is a competitive process, and there is no guarantee that a particular public agency will be awarded the excess property.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(h)(1)\u2013(h)(3).\n6 Transfer to Another Award.  Transfer the property to another FTA eligible Award.  The federal interest continues.\n7 Retain Title with Buyout.  Compensate FTA by computing the percentage of FTA participation in the original cost.  Multiply the current fair market value of the property by this percentage.  The recipient must document the basis for value determination; typically, this documentation is an\nappraisal or market survey.  Alternatively, the recipient may pay FTA the straight line depreciated value of improvements plus land value, if this is greater than FTA\u2019s share of the fair market value.\n8 Sales Procedure.  Sales procedures shall be followed that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return or at least payment of appraised fair market value.\n3. FTA MANAGEMENT AND PROJECT OVERSIGHT OF PROPERTY ACQUISITION.  FTA stewardship of an Award includes various strategies, and in some cases involves the application of risk management techniques.  Based on various conditions including dollar thresholds and the complexity of the property acquisitions involved, FTA may require the submission of all transactions meeting certain criteria for prior approval.  Refer to the discussion of prior concurrence for certain appraisal, condemnation, and settlement issues discussed in Chapter IV of this circular.\nFTA may also conduct a process or transactional review at any time during or after implementation of the real estate acquisition program to ensure compliance with the governing laws and regulations.\n4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES (INCLUDING ROLLING STOCK).  Management standards apply to equipment and supplies purchased with federal assistance.  The term \u201cfederally assisted property\u201d, as used in this section, includes equipment, including rolling stock, and supplies.  Rolling stock describes equipment that is used to transport passengers and includes buses, vans, cars, railcars, locomotives, trolley cars and buses, ferryboats, and vehicles used for guideways and incline planes.  Light duty vehicles, such as vans, sedans, and pick-up trucks, employed in administrative and maintenance purposes are considered equipment.  Light duty vehicles employed to transport passengers are considered rolling stock.  The following requirements are for the acquisition, use, management, and disposition of federally assisted property: a. State Recipients and Other Than State Recipients.   (1) The Uniform Guidance provides that a state will use, manage, and dispose of federally assisted property acquired under an Award by the state in accordance with state laws and procedures, 2 CFR \u00a7 200.313(b).  Subrecipients of states shall follow policies and procedures allowed by the state with respect to the use, management and disposal of federally assisted property, 2 CFR \u00a7 1201.313.\n(2) The Uniform Guidance also provides that recipients other than states must follow FTA requirements and procedures outlined below.\nb. Property Title.  Title to federally assisted property acquired under an Award is vested in the recipient.  The title must be a conditional title, subject to the following conditions: (1) Federally assisted property must be used for authorized purposes of the project during the useful life of the asset or until no longer needed for the purposes of the project;\n(2) The recipient must not encumber the property without prior approval from FTA or the pass-through entity; and\n(3) The property must be used and disposed of in accordance with the requirements located in this chapter, as", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "4167a670-5023-4386-96d1-6ca4b9ffbe4f"}, "1545881822059142995": {"text": " well as 2 CFR \u00a7 200.313 for equipment (including rolling stock), and 2 CFR \u00a7 200.314 for supplies.\nc. Federal Interest.  FTA retains a federal interest in any federally assisted property financed with FTA assistance until, and to the extent that, FTA relinquishes its federal interest in that federally assisted property.  This applies to real property, equipment and supplies.\nd. Acquisition.  The acquisition cost of federally assisted property means the purchase price of the property acquired for this Award.  This is the net invoice unit price, including the cost of modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the federally assisted property usable for the intended purpose.  Other charges such as the cost of inspection, installation, transportation, taxes, duty, or protective in-transit insurance should be treated in accordance with the recipient\u2019s regular accounting practices as separate line items.  Recipients must follow the procurement procedures set forth in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 4220.1 to the extent it complies with federal laws and regulations.\nTwo areas of particular importance for rolling stock procurements are:\n(1) Buy America.  FTA may not obligate federal assistance for an Award unless the steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in the Award are produced in the Unites States, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5323(j).  When procuring rolling stock, the cost of components and subcomponents produced in the United States (i) for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, is more than 60 percent of the cost of all components of the rolling stock; (ii) for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, is more than 65 percent of the cost of all components of the rolling stock; and (iii) for fiscal year 2020 and each fiscal year thereafter, is more than 70 percent of the cost of all components of the rolling stock.  Additionally, final assembly of the rolling stock must occur in the United States.  FTA strongly advises recipients to review the FTA Buy America regulations, before undertaking any procurement.  See also FTA\u2019s Buy America Web site for further policy and decision documents.\n(2) Pre-Award and Post-Delivery Reviews for Rolling Stock.  FTA requires that recipients purchasing revenue passenger rolling stock undertake reviews of the rolling stock before award of the bid, during manufacture, and following delivery of the rolling stock.  Applicants seeking to acquire rolling stock must certify that they will comply with FTA\u2019s pre-award and post-delivery review requirements.\nThe requirement to undertake the pre-award and post-delivery reviews arises from 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5323(m) and is implemented by FTA regulations at 49 CFR part 663.  The reviews are intended to improve compliance with Buy America requirements, the recipient\u2019s bid specifications, and federal motor vehicle safety standards.  FTA has tried to carry out the intent of the law in a way that builds on current practices\nby many recipients and that improves the monitoring of compliance in the least burdensome manner.  Reviews may be conducted by the recipient\u2019s staff or by a contractor for the recipient.  The regulations require a resident inspector who is not an agent or an employee of the manufacturer to review for the recipient the manufacturer\u2019s compliance with the specification at the manufacturing site.  An inspection is not required when the procurement is for unmodified vans, 10 or fewer buses acquired by an operator serving an urbanized area with a population of more than 200,000 persons, or 20 or fewer buses acquired by an operator serving other than urbanized areas or urbanized areas with populations of 200,000 or fewer.  The recipient must keep on file and make available to FTA upon request written reports resulting from the reviews.  Compliance must be certified on the Annual List of Certifications and Assurances.  FTA has published a handbook to assist with conducting pre-award and post-delivery audits for bus and railcar procurements, which contains copies of all the required certifications to assist recipients in complying with this requirement.  A copy of this handbook can be found on FTA\u2019s Buy America Web site.\ne. Use of Federally Assisted Property.  The Recipient must use federally assisted property for the purpose for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the Award continues to be supported with federal assistance.  Recipients must not encumber property without prior FTA approval.  Recipients must immediately notify FTA when changing the use of their federally assisted property or withdrawing that property from use whether by planned withdrawal, misuse, or casualty loss.  When the need for federally assisted property no longer exists, see disposition requirements in Chapter IV, subsection 4.o, \u201cDisposition of Equipment and Supplies,\u201d of this Circular. (1) Continuing Control.  The recipient agrees to maintain continuing control of the use of federally assisted property and constructed improvements to the extent satisfactory to FTA.  The recipient agrees to use federally assisted property for appropriate purposes continuously for the duration of the useful life of that property, as required by FTA.  If the recipient unreasonably delays or fails to use its federally assisted property during the useful life of that property, the recipient agrees that it may be required to return the entire amount of the federal assistance expended on that property to FTA.  The recipient further agrees to notify FTA immediately when any federally assisted property is withdrawn from use under the Award or when any federally assisted property is used in a manner substantially different from the representations the recipient made in the Grant or Cooperative Agreement for the Award.\nThe recipient may make federally assisted property available for use in other Awards currently or previously supported by the Federal Government, provided such use will not interfere with the work on the Award for which it was originally acquired.  First preference must be given to other Awards supported by FTA; and second preference must be given to programs or projects of other federal agencies.  Use for non-federally assisted programs or projects is permissible in some cases, as described in the discussion of incidental use in this chapter.\nFor Awards made prior to December 26, 2014, the recipient must not use property acquired with federal assistance to provide services to compete unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services. See 49 CFR \u00a7 18.32(c)(3).\nFor Awards made on or after December 26, 2014, the recipient must not use equipment acquired with the federal Award to provide services for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services unless specifically authorized by federal statute for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.  (See 2 CFR \u00a7 200.313(c)(3)).  Non-transit use of FTA assisted property is acceptable so long as it is incidental, does not interfere with transit use (transit has priority), and income generated is retained by the recipient for transit use.  Recipients also need to be mindful that the provision of charter service is prohibited under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5323(d).  See also FTA\u2019s Charter Regulations, 49 CFR part 604.\nThe recipient agrees that it will not execute any transfer of title, lease, lien, pledge, mortgage, encumbrance, third-party contract, subagreement, grant anticipation note, alienation, innovative finance arrangement, or any other obligation pertaining to the federally assisted property that in any way would affect the continuing federal interest in the use of that federally assisted property, without written FTA approval.\n(2) Shared Use.  Shared use of federally assisted property requires prior written FTA approval except when it involves coordinated public transit human services transportation.  Shared use projects should be clearly identified and sufficient detail provided to FTA at the time of review before an Award to determine allocable costs related to non-transit use for construction, as well as ongoing maintenance, and operation costs.  See section 2 of this chapter, above, for further information related to shared use for real property whose principles apply to equipment.\n(3) Incidental Use.  Any incidental use of federally assisted property will not exceed that permitted under applicable federal laws, regulations, and directives.  Incidental use requires prior FTA approval except when it involves coordinated public transit human services transportation.  Consult your FTA regional or metropolitan office prior to incorporating incidental use activities in projects.  See section 2 of this chapter, above, for further information related to incidental use for real property whose principles apply to equipment.  Incidental use will be permitted if: a) The incidental use does not interfere with the recipient\u2019s project or public transportation operations;\nb) The recipient fully recaptures all costs related to the incidental use from the non- transit public entity or private entity, including all applicable excise taxes on fuel for fueling facilities and wear and tear to capital improvements;\nc) The recipient uses revenues received from the incidental use for capital and/or operating expenses that were or will be incurred to provide the public transportation; and\nd) Private entities pay all applicable excise taxes on fuel.\n(4) Delay or Failure to Use Federally Assisted Property.  Recipients are required to use federally assisted property continuously and appropriately throughout the useful life of the property.  Recipients may be required to return the entire amount of federal assistance spent on federally assisted property if, during its useful life, the recipient has unreasonably delayed or failed to use the federally assisted property.  Recipients are also required to notify FTA before property is removed from the transit service originally in", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "4426e0ca-b76e-4570-a1dc-bd1c376df186"}, "1284323665873710347": {"text": "tended at the time of the Award and if property is put to additional or substitute uses.\nf. Minimum Useful Life of Federally Assisted Property.  FTA provides a minimum useful life policy for capital rolling stock, trolleys, ferries, and facilities in this circular.  If property is prematurely withdrawn from service, FTA must be immediately notified (See Section 4.o.(3) of this Chapter, \u201cDisposition or Inappropriate Use Before the End of the Asset\u2019s Useful Life\u201d).   (1) Determining Minimum Useful Life for Federally Assisted Property.  The recipient should identify the method used to determine the minimum useful life.  Acceptable methods to determine minimum useful life include but are not limited to: a) Generally accepted accounting principles;\nb) Independent evaluation;\nc) Manufacturer\u2019s estimated useful life;\nd) Internal Revenue Service guidelines;\ne) Industry standards;\nf) Recipient experience;\ng) The recipient\u2019s independent auditor who needs to provide his or her concurrence that the useful life assigned to the property is reasonable for depreciation purposes; and\nh) Proven useful life developed at a federal test facility.\n(2) FTA Minimum Useful Life Policy for Rolling Stock and Ferries.  The useful life of rolling stock and ferries begins on the date the vehicle is placed in revenue service and continues until it is removed from revenue service.  The minimum useful life in years refers to total time in transit revenue service, not time spent stockpiled or otherwise unavailable for regular transit use.  The minimum useful life in miles refers to total miles in transit revenue service.  Non-revenue miles and periods of extended removal from service do not count towards useful life.  Changes in operating circumstances, including unforeseen difficulty maintaining vehicles,\nhigher cost of fuel, and changes in local law limiting where vehicles can be operated do not excuse minimum useful life requirements.\nRecipients of federal assistance need to specify the expected minimum useful life in invitations for bids when acquiring new vehicles.  Minimum useful life is determined by years of service or accumulation of miles whichever comes first, by asset type as follows:\na) Buses: 1 Large, heavy-duty transit buses including over-the-road buses (approximately 35' \u2013 40' or larger including articulated buses):\nAt least 12 years of service or an accumulation of at least 500,000 miles.\n2 Small size, heavy-duty transit buses:\nAt least 10 years or an accumulation of at least 350,000 miles.\n3 Medium-size, medium-duty transit buses:\nAt least seven years or an accumulation of at least 200,000 miles.\n4 Medium-size, light-duty transit buses:\nAt least five years or an accumulation of at least 150,000 miles.\nb) Light Duty Vehicles:\nOther light-duty vehicles used as equipment and to transport passengers (revenue service), such as regular and specialized vans, sedans, and light-duty buses including all bus models exempt from testing in the current 49 CFR part 665:\nAt least four years or an accumulation of at least 100,000 miles.\nc) Trolleys:\nThe term \u201ctrolley\u201d is often applied to a wide variety of vehicles.  Thus, the useful life depends on the type of trolley. FTA classifies trolleys and the suggested useful life as described below.  For disposition actions, FTA will use the following minimum useful life determinations:\n1 A fixed guideway steel-wheeled \u201ctrolley\u201d (streetcar or other light rail vehicle): At least 25 years,\n2 A fixed guideway electric trolley-bus with rubber tires obtaining power from overhead catenary: At least 15 years, and\n3 Simulated trolleys, with rubber tires and internal combustion engine (often termed \u201ctrolley-replica buses\u201d). Please refer to bus useful life criteria above.\nd) Rail Vehicles.  At time of application, the recipient may propose an alternative useful life to be reviewed by FTA.  A recipient that regularly measures lifespan by hours of operations, or by any other measure, may develop an appropriate methodology for converting its system to years of service.  The reasonableness of such methodologies will be subject to examination, particularly if the recipient proposes to retire a rail vehicle before reaching FTA\u2019s useful life.  At least 25 years.\ne) Ferries.  The useful life of a ferry depends on several factors, including the type and use of the ferry.  FTA recommends using one of the methods outlined in Chapter IV, subsection 4.f.(1) above or offers the following suggested minimum service lives: 1 Passenger ferries: At least 25 years,\n2 Other ferries (without overhaul): At least 30 years, and\n3 Other ferries (with overhaul): At least 60 years.\nf) Facilities.  Determining the useful life of a facility must take into consideration such factors as the type of construction, nature of the equipment used, historical usage patterns, and technological developments.  Based on any of the methods identified above in Chapter IV, Paragraph 4.f(1), a railroad or highway structure has a minimum useful life of 50 years, and most other buildings and facilities (concrete, steel, and frame construction) have a useful life of 40 years.\ng. Rolling Stock Rebuilding Policies.  FTA laws, regulations, policies, and procedures permit the use of capital assistance for vehicle rebuilding programs that meet the vehicle requirements in the Federal Motor Carrier Vehicle Safety Standards, 49 CFR part 571, and Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Specifications for Transportation, 49 CFR part 38.  Requirements are summarized below: (1) Buses to be rebuilt must be at the end of their minimum useful life and in need of major structural and/or mechanical rebuilding.  The age of the bus to be rebuilt is its years of service at the time the rebuilding begins.  The eligibility of this major capital bus rebuild work is in addition to the eligibility of vehicle overhauls as described in Chapter IV, subsection 4.h, \u201cRolling Stock Overhauls,\u201d below.  Recipients should contact the regional or metropolitan office to determine the extent to which the useful life of the bus is affected by the rebuild.  The minimum extension of useful life is four years, or miles equivalent to four years.\nWith prior approval, FTA may permit the recipient to rebuild a vehicle that has not yet met its minimum useful life.  In such circumstances, the minimum useful life of\nthe rebuilt vehicle is the remaining useful life of the vehicle at time of rebuild plus four years, or miles equivalent to four years (e.g., for a 12-year bus rebuilt at 11 years, the remaining useful life would be 5 years).\n(2) Railcars to be rebuilt must have reached the end of their minimum useful life (end-of-life rebuild).  The minimum extension of useful life is 10 years.  The eligibility of this major capital rail rebuild work is in addition to the eligibility for vehicle overhauls as described below in Chapter IV, subsection 4.h, \u201cRolling Stock Overhauls.\u201d\nWith prior approval, FTA may permit the recipient to rebuild a railcar that has not yet met minimum useful life.  In such circumstances, the minimum useful life of the rebuilt railcar is the remaining useful life in the railcar at time of rebuild plus ten years (e.g., for a 25-year railcar rebuilt at 24 years, the remaining useful life would be 11 years).\nDepending upon the extent of rebuilding planned, the rebuild may be subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.\nh. Rolling Stock Overhauls.  Rolling stock overhauls are an eligible capital expense as preventive maintenance.  This eligibility for capital assistance applies also to rolling stock that has been leased or acquired by a contractor, and to contracted service.  Overhauls are usually done to make sure rolling stock reaches its useful life.  Overhaul does not extend the useful life of rolling stock.  This eligibility is in addition to eligibility of rebuilding specifically discussed above in Chapter IV, subsection 4.g.  For rolling stock to be overhauled, it must have accumulated at least 40 percent of its useful life.\ni. Rolling Stock Repowering.  Rolling stock repowering involves replacing a vehicle\u2019s propulsion system with a propulsion system of a different type (e.g., replacing a diesel engine with an electric battery propulsion system).  Rolling stock repowering is permitted for buses that have met at least 40 percent of their useful life in which case it must be designed to permit the bus to meet its useful life requirements or as part of a rebuild in which case it must extend the useful life by at least 4 years, or an additional 125,000 miles.\nj. Previously-Owned Vehicles (Including Remanufactured Vehicles).  Previously-owned and remanufactured vehicles must meet the following requirements: (1) Procurement.  The recipient must identify in their procurement their intent to purchase previously-owned and/or remanufactured vehicles.  As part of the bid or proposal the recipient must obtain certification and documentation ascertaining that applicable Bus Testing and Buy America requirements have been met by the original owner or remanufacturer.\n(2) Useful Life.  The grant application and procurement of a previously-owned vehicle must identify the applicable useful life for the vehicle.\n(3) Bus Testing.  The original vehicles must have met the Bus Testing Requirements in place at the time of acquisition by the original owner.\n(4) Buy America.  The original vehicles must have met the Buy America requirements in place at the time of acquisition by the original owner.  Remanufactured vehicles must meet the applicable Buy America requirements for rolling stock for all new components and subcomponents added or replaced on the vehicle.\n(5) DBE Requirements. When a remanufacturer responds to a solicitation for new, or remanufactured vehicles, with a vehicle that has post-production alterations or retro-fitting to provide a \u201clike new\u201d vehicle, the remanufacturer is considered a transit vehicle manufacturer and must comply with the DOT DBE regulations.\nk", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "76377402-2037-4d04-b2f0-76c910ca129b"}, "8438492495705402873": {"text": ". Rolling Stock Spare Ratio Policies.  Spare ratios will be taken into account in the review of Award proposed to replace, rebuild, or acquire additional vehicles.  Spare ratio is defined as the total number of spare vehicles available for fixed-route service (regardless of type) divided by the total number of fixed-route vehicles required for annual maximum service (regardless of type).  Spare ratio is usually expressed as a percentage, e.g., 100 vehicles required for maximum fixed-route service and 20 spare vehicles is a 20 percent spare ratio.  Spare ratios are calculated for the transit system as a whole, not by vehicle type.\nFor purposes of the spare ratio calculation, \u201cvehicles operated in maximum fixed-route service\u201d is defined as the total number of revenue vehicles operated to meet the annual maximum service requirement.  This is the revenue vehicle count during the peak week, day and hours maximum service is provided.  It excludes atypical days and special events.\n(1) Bus Fleet.  The basis for determining a reasonable spare bus ratio takes local circumstances into account.  The number of spare buses in the active fleet for recipients operating 50 or more fixed-route revenue vehicles should not exceed 20 percent of the number of vehicles operated in maximum fixed-route service.  FTA does not set a specific spare ratio for smaller operators, but expects the number of spare buses to be reasonable, taking into account the number of vehicles and variety of vehicle types and sizes.\nBuses delivered for future expansion and buses that have been replaced, but are in the process of being disposed of, are not included in the calculation of spare ratio.\nFor each application identified to acquire vehicles, the applicant should address the subjects of current spare ratio, the spare ratio anticipated at the time the new vehicles are introduced into service, disposition of vehicles to be replaced including information on age and mileage, and the applicant\u2019s conformance with FTA\u2019s spare ratio guideline.  An applicant is required to notify FTA if the spare ratio computation on which the application is based is significantly altered before the Award is made.\n(2) Rail Fleet.  Because rail transit operations tend to be highly individualized, FTA has not established a specific number to serve as an acceptable spare ratio for rail transit operations.  Nevertheless, rail operators should be aware that the recipient\u2019s rail vehicle spare ratio and the rationale underlying that spare ratio will be examined during the triennial review whenever FTA assistance is used to purchase or rebuild rail vehicles.\nThe following guidance should be used to support an operator\u2019s proposed rail vehicle spare ratio when the spare ratio is under review by FTA:\na) An operator of a rail system should have in its file available upon request by FTA a rail fleet management plan that addresses operating policies (level of service requirements; train failure definitions, and actions); peak vehicle requirements (service period and make-up, e.g., standby trains); maintenance and overhaul programs (scheduled, unscheduled, and overhaul); system and service expansions; railcar procurements and related schedules; and spare ratio justifications.\nb) The spare ratio justification should consider the average number of railcars out of service for scheduled maintenance, the unscheduled maintenance and overhaul program, the allowance for ridership variation (historical data), ridership changes that affect railcar needs caused by expansion of the system or services, the contingency for destroyed railcars, and railcar procurements for replacements and system expansions.\nc) Railcars delivered for future expansion and railcars that have been replaced, but are in the process of being disposed of, should not be included in the calculation of spare ratio.\nd) Peak Vehicle Requirements include \u201cstandby\u201d trains that are scheduled, ready for service, and have a designated crew.\ne) Factors that may influence spare ratios are the type of equipment (locomotive hauled trains; married pair units or single railcars, equipment design, reliability, and age), environmental conditions (weather, above ground or underground operation, loading and track layout), operational policies (standby trains, load factors, headways), maintenance policies (conditions for removing railcars from service, maintenance during nights and weekends, and labor agreement conditions), and maintenance facilities and staff capabilities.\n(3) Spare Ratio Deviation.  Recipients of buses recently procured may temporarily exceed their spare ratio thresholds.  In those cases, recipients may seek a short-term deviation from the spare ratio requirements for small deviations.  Recipients should prepare a brief justification explaining the reason for the deviation, a date by which the fleet spare ratio will come into compliance with the general requirements, and the recipient\u2019s plans to come into compliance.  The deviation will generally be\ngranted for no more than two (2) years and must be approved by the regional administrator either in writing or by approval of the Award.\nRecipients must promptly inform the Regional Office of any significant changes related to spare ratios, including plans for disposition or acquisition of vehicles and changes in vehicle needs.\n(4) Contingency Fleet. FTA recognizes two types of vehicles\u2014active and contingency.  Revenue rolling stock stockpiled in a contingency fleet in preparation for emergencies must have met their minimum useful life requirements and must be properly stored, maintained, and documented in a contingency plan.  FTA will also permit agencies to include vehicles that have met their minimum useful life in their contingency fleet if an agency is introducing zero emission vehicles into its fleet.  These vehicles are not included in the calculation of spare ratio.  Contingency plans are subject to review during triennial reviews and other FTA oversight reviews.  Any rolling stock not supported by a contingency plan will be considered part of the active fleet.\nContingency fleet means inactive rolling stock reserved or retained for emergencies or other unforeseen and justified activities.  These activities could include the evacuation of people during an emergency, use as crowd control or traffic barriers, loaners to other transit agencies during a justified need, temporary replacements for buses in the active fleet during major active fleet overhauls or bus maintenance activities and other activities that take a portion of the active fleet temporarily out of service.\nThe recipient should keep a record of information that demonstrates the need for the contingency fleet activation, the justification for activation and the period of time of activation.  The contingency fleet plan should demonstrate that the bus has met its useful life by identifying the year the bus was placed in service, the year and mileage when removed from service and the useful life of the bus in years and miles.  The plan should identify where the buses will be stored, how they will be protected and list the maintenance activities performed on the bus to ensure they maintain their contingency bus fleet status.\nA contingency fleet is separate from the spare fleet, and is not included in the spare ratio.\nl. Leases.  FTA and standard accounting rules distinguish between operating and capital leases.\n(1) Capital Lease.  A capital lease is any transaction whereby the grantee acquires the right to use a capital asset.  If a lease does not have the following characteristics, it is an operating lease:   a) the lease cannot be cancelled; and\nb) any one of the following is true:   1 the term of the lease is equal to or greater than 75 percent of the useful life of the asset;\n2 the grantee will become the owner of the asset at the end of the lease term;\n3 the lease contains an option to purchase the leased property at a bargain price;\n4 the present value of the rent is equal to 90 percent of the value of the property.\n(2) Capital Leases in General.  The FAST Act amended the definition of \u201ccapital project\u201d to remove the requirement that a capital lease be \u201csubject to regulations that the Secretary prescribes limiting the leasing arrangements to those that are more cost-effective than purchase or construction.\u201d This applies to any lease financed with FTA assistance.  As a result, 49 CFR part 639, subpart C, pertaining to cost effectiveness requirements, does not apply to capital leases:\nA lease may qualify for capital assistance if it meets the following criteria:\na) The capital asset to be acquired by lease is eligible for capital assistance; and\nb) There is or will be no existing federal interest in the capital asset as of the date the lease will take effect.\nFor the purposes of this definition, it does not matter if the lease qualifies as a tax exempt municipal lease in which the private lender holding the lease would not pay income taxes on the interest earned from the lease payments received.\n(3) Capital Leases Under Section 3019(c) of the FAST Act.  Section 3019 of the FAST Act established an \u201cInnovative Procurement\u201d program, of which one purpose is to establish new conditions pertaining to the leasing of \u201crolling stock or related equipment.\u201d For purposes of Section 3019(c), a capital lease is defined as any agreement in which a recipient acquires the right to use rolling stock or related equipment for a specified period of time, in exchange for a periodic payment.  Therefore, Section 3019 provisions are limited to leases of rolling stock or related equipment. a) Eligible lease costs of rolling stock or related equipment include the costs of the rolling stock or related equipment; associated financing costs, including interest, legal fees, and financial advisor fees; ancillary costs such as delivery and installation charges; and maintenance costs.  A capital lease may also require that the lessor provide maintena", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "5a9b0953-4f18-466c-baa2-2fa30ac6f311"}, "5307714380982728173": {"text": "nce of the rolling stock or related equipment covered by the lease.  The purchase calculation should include an estimate of residual value.\nRemovable power sources for zero emission vehicles may be acquired separately as capital leases.\nb) Based on standard FTA Award management guidelines, recipients must maintain an inventory of assets acquired through capital leasing and must maintain on their accounting records the lease liability.\nc) Terms.  A recipient shall negotiate the terms of any lease agreement that the recipient enters into.\nd) Applicability of procurement requirements. 1 Lease requirements. \u2014 Part 639, subpart C, of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, \u201cCost Effectiveness\u201d or any successor regulation, and implementing guidance applicable to leasing is no longer applicable.  Eligibility of lease expenses is instead governed by 2 CFR 200. a Buy America.\u2014The requirements under section 5323(j) of title 49, United States Code, shall apply to a capital lease.\n2 Removable power sources are subject to section 2 CFR \u00a7 200.88 \u201cSimplified Acquisition Threshold.\u201d  Those leases, even those over the threshold (currently $150,000), may use small purchase procedures.\ne) Lease Reporting Requirements.  Not later than 3 years after the date in which a recipient enters into a capital lease for rolling stock or related equipment, the recipient must submit a report in TrAMS that contains: 1 An evaluation of the overall costs and benefits of leasing rolling stock, (including both the base and option years); and\n2 A comparison of the expected short-term and long-term maintenance costs of leasing versus buying rolling stock.\n(4) The Recipient as Lessor.  In all instances in which the recipient is a lessor (the party leasing an asset to another), the recipient must obtain FTA\u2019s written concurrence before leasing federally assisted assets to others.  In addition, for equipment leasing, recipients must comply with FTA\u2019s Charter Service regulations, School Bus Operations regulations, and with requirements below:\n(5) Leasing FTA Assisted Assets to Others for Transit Service.  The recipient may enter into a contract for leasing its federally assisted property to a private operator (the lessee).  The lease must be subject to and incorporate by reference the terms and conditions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  Under this arrangement, the recipient (the lessor) should include the following provisions in the proposed lease agreement: 1 The federally assisted property shall be operated by the lessee to serve the best interests and welfare of the recipient, lessor, and the public; the terms and conditions for operation of service imposed by the recipient shall be evidenced in a service agreement;\n2 The lessee shall maintain the federally assisted property at a high level of cleanliness, safety, and mechanical soundness under maintenance procedures outlined by the recipient; the recipient, lessor, and/or FTA shall have the right to conduct periodic maintenance inspections for the purpose of confirming the existence, condition, and the proper maintenance of the federally assisted property; and\n3 The lease needs to cross reference a service agreement.  A default under the lease is a default under the service agreement and vice versa.\nm. Transit Asset Management (TAM) Regulations.  All recipients and subrecipients of FTA federal assistance must follow the regulations found in 49 CFR part 625, \u201cTransit Asset Management,\u201d including the requirement to develop or participate in the development of a Transit Asset Management Plan, or a Group Plan, by October 1, 2018, and amendments to 49 CFR part 630, \u201cNational Transit Database,\u201d which includes reporting requirements.\nn. Management of Federally Assisted Property.  Rolling stock and equipment management procedures include the following minimum requirements:  (1) Equipment records must be maintained by the recipient.  Records must include the following:  a) A description of the asset;\nb) The identification number or serial number;\nc) The entity or individual that holds title to the asset;\nd) The source of funding (the FAIN number under which it was procured);\ne) The acquisition date;\nf) The cost of the asset;\ng) The percentage of federal participation in the cost;\nh) The location;\ni) The use and condition;\nj) The useful life; and\nk) The disposition data, including the date of disposal and sale price, or, where applicable, method used to determine its fair market value.\n(2) A physical inventory of the equipment must be taken and the results reconciled with equipment records at least once every two years.  Any differences must be investigated to determine the cause of the difference.  Property should be tagged or otherwise identified as federally assisted property.\n(3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of federally assisted property.  The recipient must investigate and document any loss, damage, or theft.\n(4) Maintenance and Warranty. a) Maintenance.  Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed and implemented to keep the federally assisted property in good condition.  Recipients must maintain federally assisted property in good operating order and in compliance with any applicable federal regulations that may be issued and follow applicable guidance that may be issued, except to the extent that FTA determines otherwise in writing.  Recipients must have a written vehicle maintenance plan and a facility/equipment maintenance plan.  These plans should describe a system of periodic inspections and preventive maintenance to be performed at certain defined intervals.\nb) Records and Oversight.  Recipients must keep satisfactory records pertaining to the use of federally assisted property, and submit to FTA upon request such information as may be required to assure compliance with federal requirements.  Recipients must have appropriate procedures in place to ensure that management and oversight of federally assisted property is properly administered for assets controlled by subrecipients.\nc) Warranties.  Warranties, when part of rolling stock and equipment contracts, should provide for correction of defective or unacceptable materials or workmanship.  These warranties should specify coverage and duration and meet currently available industry standards.  A general warranty incorporating industry standards and an extended warranty are eligible capital costs.  FTA\u2019s Best Practices Procurement Manual encourages recipients to evaluate the cost of an extended warranty in an analysis separate from the equipment\u2019s acquisition cost, in order to make a good business decision.  Recipients are responsible for: 1 Establishing and maintaining a system for recording warranty claims; this system should provide information needed by the recipient on the extent and provisions of coverage and on claims processing procedures; and\n2 Identifying and diligently enforcing the system for recording warranty claims.\no. Disposition of Equipment and Supplies.  Disposition requirements apply to equipment that has met its useful life, as well as equipment that is prematurely withdrawn from service before its useful life has been ended.  FTA retains financial interest in equipment\nwith a unit value exceeding $5000, and supplies with an aggregate value exceeding $5000, even if useful life has been met.  State recipients must dispose of federally assisted property acquired under an Award by the state in accordance with state laws and procedures.  Subrecipients of states will follow such policies and procedures allowed by the state with respect to disposition of equipment acquired under an FTA Award.   (1) Calculating the Federal Interest.  FTA is entitled to its share of the remaining federal interest upon disposition of federally assisted property before the end of its useful life or for a value greater than $5,000 after the useful life has been met.    a) The federal interest is determined by calculating the fair market value of the federally assisted property immediately before the occurrence prompting the withdrawal of that property from appropriate use (e.g., sale, loss, etc.).  The federal interest that the recipient is required to return to FTA is the greater of FTA\u2019s share of the unamortized value of the remaining useful life per unit, based on straight line depreciation of the original purchase price or the federal share of the sales price.  The following example is provided to determine the straight line depreciation of a vehicle: for a vehicle with a 12-year, 500,000-mile minimum useful life, the vehicle\u2019s value decreases each year by one-twelfth of its original purchase price.  Alternatively, the value decreases for each mile driven 1/500,000 of its original purchase price.  The unamortized value of the remaining useful life per unit is the value obtained by calculating the straight line depreciation based on either miles or years whichever is more advantageous to the recipient.\nb) Any exchange of funds or trade of equipment or services in consideration for the federally assisted property is considered a sale.  The sales price is based on the value of the funds, equipment, or services provided by the purchaser, and the federal share of that price is calculated as described above.  Recipients and purchasers may not separate any portion of the sales prices as reimbursement in order to reduce the federal share.\nc) If the recipient is authorized to sell the property, it will be required to employ proper sales procedures that ensure the highest possible return is achieved in the disposition of the federally assisted asset.\nd) Reimbursement to FTA will be an amount calculated by multiplying the total aggregate fair market value at the time of disposition, or the net sale proceeds, by the percentage of FTA\u2019s participation in the original Award.  The recipient\u2019s transmittal letter should state whether the equipment will be retained or sold.  Use of sale", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "257ee01f-12a7-4323-8437-03a0c3e7e2c2"}, "2670200365888673515": {"text": "s proceeds are discussed elsewhere.\n(2) Replacement at End of Minimum Useful Life.  Federally assisted property to be replaced must have achieved at least the minimum useful life.  For purposes of bus replacement, the age of the bus to be replaced is its years of service or mileage at the time the proposed new bus is introduced into service.  For purposes of a rail vehicle replacement, the age of the vehicle to be replaced is its age at the time the\nnew vehicle is introduced into service.  Official property records (or a Rolling Stock Status Report), in which future needs (expansion and replacement) are discussed, must be available upon request by FTA.  Proceeds from the sale of real property, equipment, or supplies are not program income.\n(3) Disposition or Inappropriate Use Before the End of the Asset\u2019s Useful Life.  Any disposition of federally assisted property before the end of its useful life requires prior FTA approval.  FTA is entitled to its share of the remaining federal interest.   a) Transfer of Assets No Longer Needed.  For an asset that has not met its useful life and with prior FTA approval, the recipient may follow procedures for 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(h)(1) \u2013 (3) to transfer federally assisted property (real property, including land, or equipment) to a public agency for non-public transportation use provided the recipient can demonstrate that: 1 The asset will remain in public use for at least five years after the date the asset is transferred;\n2 There is no purpose eligible for assistance for which the asset should be used;\n3 The overall benefit of allowing the transfer is greater than the FTA interest in liquidation and return of FTA\u2019s remaining federal interest in the asset, after considering fair market value and other factors; and\n4 Through an appropriate screening or survey process (usually by following procedures for publication in the Federal Register), that there is no interest in acquiring the asset for the federal use if the asset is a facility or land.\nAdditional information regarding this type of disposition is available from your FTA Regional or Metropolitan Office.\nb) Casualty, Fire, Natural Disaster, and Misused Property.  When federally assisted property is lost or damaged by fire, casualty, or natural disaster, the fair market value shall be calculated on the basis of the condition of the equipment or supplies immediately before the fire, casualty, or natural disaster, irrespective of the extent of insurance coverage.  If any damage to the federally assisted property results from abuse or misuse occurring with the recipient\u2019s knowledge and consent, the recipient agrees to restore the federally assisted property to its original condition or refund the value of the federal interest in that property.\nThe recipient may fulfill its obligations to remit the federal interest by either:\n1 With prior FTA approval, following the Like-Kind Exchange Policy as described in subparagraph (d) below; or\n2 Returning to FTA an amount equal to the remaining federal interest in the withdrawn federally assisted property.\nc) Insurance Proceeds.  If the recipient receives insurance proceeds when federally assisted property has been lost or damaged by fire, casualty, or natural disaster, the recipient agrees to: 1 Apply those proceeds to the cost of replacing the federally assisted property that is damaged or destroyed or taken out of service; or\n2 Return to FTA an amount equal to the remaining federal interest in the federally assisted property that is lost, damaged, or destroyed.\nThe federal interest does not depend on the extent of insurance coverage or on the insurance adjustment received.\nExamples appear on the next page.\nApplication of Insurance Proceeds: Example 1\nInsurance Proceeds Greater than the\nRemaining Federal Interest in the Damaged or Destroyed Property.\nThe remaining federal interest in the damaged or destroyed property is $1,800.  The recipient receives insurance proceeds in the amount of $2,500.  The recipient is required to apply $1,800 of the $2,500 insurance proceeds towards the federal share of replacing the destroyed property.\nCost of Replacement Property: (Total Project Cost)\n$6,000\n\nFed Share: $4,800\nLocal: $1,200\nLess Federal Share of Insurance Proceeds:\n<$1,800>\nAdditional Federal Funds:\n$3,000\nIf the funding ratio for this property were 80 percent federal and 20 percent non-federal, the replacement property could be purchased for $4,800 federal/$1,200 non-federal funds.  The insurance proceeds of $1,800 needed to cover the remaining federal interest in the damaged and destroyed property must first be applied to the federal share of the replacement property.  The recipient could receive an additional $3,000 in federal assistance.  The recipient must provide $1,200 in non-federal share to replace the property.\n\nApplication of Insurance Proceeds: Example 2\nInsurance Proceeds Less than the\nRemaining Federal Interest in the Damaged or Destroyed Property:\nIf the federal interest in the damaged or destroyed property is $1,800 and the recipient receives insurance proceeds in the amount of $500, the recipient is required to apply the $500 of insurance proceeds and $1,300 of non-federal funds to equal the remaining federal interest, towards the cost of the replacement property.\nCost of Replacement Property: (Total Project Cost)\n$6,000\n\nFed Share: $4,800\nLocal: $1,200\nLess: Insurance Proceeds:\n$500\nNon-Federal Funds to Cover the Remaining Federal Interest:\n$1,300\nAdditional Federal Funds:\n$3,000\nIf the funding ratio for this property were 80 percent federal and 20 percent non-federal, the replacement property could be purchased for $4,800 federal/$1,200 non-federal funds.  The insurance proceeds of $500 plus an additional $1,300 in non-federal funds are needed to cover the remaining federal interest in the damaged and destroyed property.  These funds must be applied to the federal share of the replacement property.  The recipient could receive an additional $3,000 in federal assistance, and must provide an additional $1,200 in other non-federal share, to replace the property.  In total, the $6,000 is therefore covered by $500 in insurance, $3,000 in federal funds and $2,500 in non-federal funds.\n\nd) Like-Kind Exchange Policy.  With prior FTA approval, equipment may be disposed of before the end of its minimum useful life.  In lieu of returning the federal share to FTA, a recipient may elect to transfer the remaining federal interest to a replacement equipment of like kind.  For example, \u201cLike-Kind\u201d is defined as a bus for a bus with a similar useful life and a rail vehicle for a rail vehicle.  Under the Like-Kind Exchange Policy, proceeds from the federal share of the equipment disposition are not returned to FTA; instead, all proceeds are reinvested in acquisition of the like-kind replacement equipment.  If the disposition proceeds are less than the amount of the federal interest in the equipment at the time it is being replaced, the recipient is responsible for providing the difference, along with the recipient\u2019s share of the cost of the replacement equipment.  If sales proceeds are greater than the amount of the federal interest in the equipment traded in or sold, the investment of all proceeds in acquisition of the like-kind replacement equipment results in a reduction of the gross project cost.  An example (on the following page) of like-kind exchange is:\n\nExample: Like-Kind exchange\nA recipient purchased a new bus in 2009 for $220,000; 80 percent of the total price, or $176,000, was federal assistance while 20 percent, or $44,000, was non-federal.  Thus, there was an initial $176,000 \u201cfederal interest\u201d in the new vehicle.\nInstead of keeping the bus in service for 12 years, the FTA useful life of a new bus, the recipient chose to sell the bus after six years and replace it with a new vehicle.\nSince the bus had a minimum useful life of 12 years and its depreciation was determined on a \u201cstraight line\u201d basis, the depreciated value of the vehicle after six years was half the original price, or $110,000.  The remaining federal interest was 80 percent of that figure, $88,000.\nAssume, for example, the recipient realized $80,000 from the sale of the six-year-old bus, or $30,000 less than the straight line depreciated value of the original vehicle.\nThe recipient purchased the new bus in 2015 for $240,000 calculated as follows on the next page:\nNet Project Cost Calculation:\nGross Project Cost of New Bus:   $240,000\nLess Straight-Line Depreciated Value of Replaced Bus: - $110,000*\nNet Project Cost:   $130,000\nFederal Share 80%:   $104,000\nNon-federal Share 20%:   $ 26,000\nTotal:   $130,000\nRevised Federal Interest in New Bus:\nTransferred from the Old Vehicle:   $ 88,000\nFederal Share of the New Grant:   $104,000\n$192,000\n*Note: As the sale proceeds of $80,000 are less than the straight-line depreciated value of $110,000 the recipient must provide an additional $30,000 to pay for the $240,000 vehicle.\ne) If the property has never been used for appropriate purposes, the recipient shall sell the property and pay FTA the greater of FTA\u2019s share of the fair market value or the entire amount of federal assistance spent on that federally assisted property\n(4) Disposition or Use of Assets for Other Than Purposes of the Award after the End of Their Useful Life. a) Retain and Use Elsewhere.  After the minimum useful life of federally assisted property is reached or the property is no longer needed for the original Award, it may be used by the recipient for other transit projects or programs.  FTA prior approval of this alternative is not required.  FTA retains its interest in the federally assisted property if its fair market value exceeds $5,000.\nb) Disposition of Property with a Fair Market Value of More Than $5,000.  After the useful life of federally assisted property is reached, or the property is no longer needed for the original Award, rolling stock and equipment with a current market value exceed", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "d2741f9a-33e1-4eb4-b6de-65e0d106775b"}, "3666312497673636268": {"text": "ing $5,000 per unit, or unused supplies with a total aggregate fair market value of more than $5,000, may be retained or sold.  FTA is entitled to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value, or proceeds from sale, by FTA\u2019s percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase.  Rolling stock and equipment that is sold may have the amount due FTA reduced by an amount of $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for its selling and handling expenses.\nc) Sell and Use the Proceeds for Other Capital Awards, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(h)(4).  After the useful life is met, or the property is no longer needed, and with prior FTA approval, the recipient may sell its federally assisted property for which there is no longer any public transportation purposes and use the proceeds to reduce the gross project cost of other future FTA eligible capital transit Awards.  The recipient is expected to record the receipt of the proceeds in the recipient\u2019s accounting system, showing that the funds are restricted for use in a future capital Award, and reduce the liability as the proceeds are applied to one or more FTA approved capital Awards.  If new applications are not immediately anticipated, the recipient must inform the appropriate FTA contact of the disposition within a reasonable amount of time.  Otherwise, the subsequent capital application should contain information showing FTA that the gross project cost has been reduced with proceeds from the earlier transaction.  The proceeds cannot retroactively be applied to an existing Award or project unless the Award is still open.\nd) Disposition of Property with a Fair Market Value of $5,000 or Less Value.  After the useful life of its federally assisted property is reached, rolling stock and equipment with a unit market value of $5,000 or less, or supplies with a total aggregate market value of $5,000 or less, may be retained, sold, or\notherwise disposed of with no obligation to reimburse FTA.  Records of this action must be retained.  FTA approval of this action is not required.\ne) Transfer of Rolling Stock\u2014Recipient-to-Recipient.  With prior FTA approval, a recipient may transfer rolling stock that has not yet served its useful life to another recipient.  The federal interest in the rolling stock will be transferred with the rolling stock, and therefore, there is no obligation to reimburse FTA.  However, no additional FTA assistance may be used to acquire the vehicles.  Both recipients should coordinate with their FTA Regional Office(s).  The required information must be provided by the appropriate contacts for both affected transit agencies, which agencies might be in different Regional Offices.  When the rolling stock has remaining useful life, the following information should be submitted: 1 A Written Request for Approval to Transfer or Receive Vehicles.  The request should include the transferor/transferee recipient\u2019s name, list of vehicles (year, make, model), date placed in revenue service, date removed from revenue service, federal award identification number that was assigned to the original FTA Award that financed the vehicle, mileage, remaining useful life, federal share of remaining useful life, and reasons for transfer.\n2 A Board Resolution (or Other Appropriate Legal Action) from Each Recipient.  The transferring recipient\u2019s board resolution (or other appropriate legal action) should identify the receiving recipient, include a statement that the vehicles are no longer required, a list of the vehicles to be transferred including the Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs), and the remaining federal interest that is transferred to the receiving recipient.\nThe receiving recipient\u2019s board resolution (or other appropriate legal action) should identify the transferring recipient, a statement that the vehicles are needed for revenue service, a list of the vehicles to be acquired including VINs, the remaining federal interest for each vehicles, agreement that the vehicles will be maintained in accordance and in compliance with FTA requirements, and that the transferred vehicles will be included in its equipment inventory records.\n3 A Rolling Stock Status Report.  Each recipient should provide a Rolling Stock Status Report that includes all information as identified in Appendix E.  The Rolling Stock Status Report should reflect the impact that the transfer/addition of the vehicles will have on the recipient\u2019s total fleet and spare ratio.  If approved, the receiving recipient will be directed to include the transferred vehicles in its next application for federal assistance.\nf) Unused Supplies.  For the disposition of supplies for which there is no transit use with a total aggregate fair market value that exceeds $5,000, the recipient\nmust compensate FTA for its share, or transfer the sales proceeds to another Award to reduce the gross project cost of other future capital project(s), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(h)(4).\np. Insurance.  At a minimum, the recipient agrees to comply with the insurance requirements normally imposed by its state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances, except to the extent that the Federal Government determines otherwise in writing.   (1) Flood Insurance.  The Recipient agrees to have flood insurance as required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4012a(a), for any building located in a special flood hazard area (100-year flood zone), before receiving federal assistance to acquire, construct, reconstruct, repair, or improve that building.  Additionally, the building and its contents must be covered by flood insurance in an amount at least equal to the federal investment (less estimated land cost) or equal to the maximum limit of coverage made available with respect to the particular type of property under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.  Current limits are $500,000 per building and $500,000 for the contents of each building.\nFTA has defined building and contents coverage in its Emergency Relief rule, 49 CFR part 602, as follows:\na) Building.  For insurance purposes, a structure with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site.  This includes manufactured or modular office trailers that are built on a permanent chassis, transported to a site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation.\nb) Contents coverage.  For insurance purposes, contents are personal property within a building, including fixtures, machinery, equipment and supplies.  In addition to the costs to repair or replace, contents insurance coverage shall include the cost of debris removal and the reasonable cost of removal of contents to minimize damage.\n(2) Minimum Insurance.  The recipient must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved with federal assistance as provided to property owned by the recipient.\n(3) Insurance Proceeds.  If the recipient receives insurance proceeds when federally assisted property has been lost or damaged by fire, casualty, or natural disaster, the recipient agrees to: a) Apply those proceeds to the cost of replacing the federally assisted property that is damaged, destroyed, or taken out of service (listed on the preceding pages are two examples of the application of insurance proceeds); or\nb) Return to FTA an amount equal to the remaining federal interest in the federally assisted property that is lost, damaged, or destroyed.\n(4) Federal Interest.  The federal interest is not dependent on the extent of insurance coverage or on the insurance adjustment received.\n(5) Flood Risk Management.  Executive Order No. 13690, \u201cEstablishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for Further Soliciting and considering Stakeholder Input,\u201d was issued to improve the nation\u2019s resilience to flooding and to better prepare for the impacts of climate change.  This order identifies a process to avoid action in or impacting the floodplain and minimizing potential harm if an action must occur in or otherwise impact the floodplain.  If avoiding the floodplain is not possible, the Order calls for recipients to improve the resilience of communities and federal actions.  All FTA recipients receiving funding for infrastructure projects of facilities are required to follow E.O. 11988, as amended by E.O. 13690, which includes assessment of flood risk associated with proposed projects in floodplains.\n5. DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES.  Recipients are encouraged to consult FTA\u2019s Web site to review the \u201cProject and Construction Management Guidelines\u201d and the \u201cConstruction Project Management Handbook\u201d for guidance on the development and management of construction Awards.  These two resources can be found at https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grant-programs/capital-investments/project-and-construction-management-guidelines.\nThe \u201cProject and Construction Management Guidelines\u201d have been developed to assist those involved in advancing transit capital Award to achieve implementation success in terms of the project scope of work, function, schedule, cost, and quality.  Use of the \u201cProject and Construction and Management Guidelines\u201d should contribute to effective project management on the part of the recipient, and effective oversight and guidance by FTA and the Project Management Oversight (PMO) contractor.  Each phase of a construction project within an Award should: (1) start with inputs or a baseline, and (2) have a process that refines the project definition and generates outputs that become the inputs or baseline for the subsequent phase.  By defining the requirements for each phase and sound approaches to their accomplishment, the \u201cProject and Construction Management Guidelines\u201d allow recipients to define construction requirements, allocate resources, perform activities, monitor progress, and make adjustments, as required, to obtain the proper information and assure decisions are", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "b98d23b1-9350-4e69-b3dd-759c4cbc9b79"}, "8766186436821204591": {"text": " made at the appropriate time.  Adherence to the guidelines should minimize scope of work changes, schedule slippages, cost overruns, and quality problems, and contribute to fully meeting all the performance objectives of the transit capital Award.\nThe purpose of the \u201cConstruction Project Management Handbook\u201d is to provide guidelines for use by public transit agencies undertaking substantial construction projects within an Award, either for the first time or with little prior experience with construction project management.  The handbook provides a comprehensive introduction to construction project management, including the applicability of the principles of project management and of all phases of project development\u2014from project initiation through planning, environmental clearance, real estate acquisition, design, construction, commissioning, and closeout.  The handbook provides guidance tailored more to agencies that are constructing maintenance and\noperational facilities, intermodal terminals, park-and-ride stations, and other similar supporting transit facilities.\na. Environmental Mitigation.\nAll projects seeking FTA assistance require compliance with NEPA implementing regulations, 40 CFR parts 1500-1508, FHWA and FTA\u2019s Environmental Impact and Related Procedures, 23 CFR part 771, and other environmental laws, regulations, and Executive Orders such as regulations pertaining to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act.  The process for preparing an EIS, EA, and CE under NEPA and completing any environmental permit, approval, review, or study required for a project under federal laws, regulations, and orders is commonly referred to as the \u201cenvironmental review process,\u201d 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 139.  FTA\u2019s policy is \u201cthat measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts be incorporated into the proposed actions.\u201d Measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts are eligible for federal assistance when FTA determines that: (1) the impacts for which the mitigation is proposed actually result from the project under review, and (2) the proposed mitigation represents a reasonable public expenditure after considering the impacts of the action and the benefits of the proposed mitigation measures, 23 CFR \u00a7 771.105(d).\nFTA considers mitigation measures for all adverse environmental and community impacts under NEPA and for specific resources under Section 4(f), the Endangered Species Act, Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the project-level conformity requirements of the Clean Air Act, and other federal environmental laws and executive orders that may apply to the particular project.  Mitigation measures are developed jointly by FTA and the recipient during the environmental review process to address federal environmental requirements as well as state and local requirements.  It is the responsibility of the recipient, in cooperation with the FTA, to implement those mitigation measure stated as commitments in the environmental decision document (i.e., the Categorical Exclusion (CE), the Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), or the Federal Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS)/Record of Decision (ROD).\nWhen FTA makes an Award, the mitigation measures are incorporated by reference in the Grant or Cooperative Agreement for the implementation of the project and the commitment to the mitigation measure becomes a condition of the Award that cannot be removed or substantively changed without FTA\u2019s written approval.  FTA regional staff monitors the implementation of the identified mitigation commitments through periodic reporting (e.g., quarterly reports), reviews of design, construction inspections, and special meetings, as necessary.  The recipient has the responsibility to apprise FTA at the earliest possible time of any problems in implementing the adopted measures and any need for changes.\nInformation about FTA\u2019s environmental review process is available through the FTA Regional Office.\nb. Project Management Plan.  A written Project Management Plan (PMP) is required by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5327 for all major capital projects.  Recipients are required to develop and\nimplement a PMP for all major capital projects financed by FTA as part of the Project Management Oversight (PMO) Program.  This plan covers a recipient\u2019s detailed project management strategy to control the project scope of work, budget, schedule, and quality (49 CFR part 633).  Requirements for the PMP can be found in the latest version of Project Management Oversight regulations and FTA\u2019s Web site at https://www.transit.dot.gov/.\nAs a general rule, if the project meets the definition of major capital project, the recipient must submit the PMP during the application review process.  FTA may also require a PMP to be submitted for other Award as deemed appropriate.  If FTA determines the project is a major capital project after the Award has been approved or if FTA determines that a PMP must be submitted for other projects after the Award has been approved, FTA will inform the recipient of its determination and will require submission of the plan.  An approval of a PMP can be made after the Award is made.\nc. Utility Relocation. (1) General.  The construction of transit systems may require the relocation and/or rearrangement of privately and publicly owned utilities.  These utilities include, but are not limited to, systems and physical plants for producing, transmitting, or distributing communications, electricity, gas, oil, crude oil products, water, steam, waste storm water, or other substances, publicly owned fire and police signal systems, and railroads and streets which directly or indirectly serve the public.  Relocating and/or rearranging utilities and facilities necessary to accommodate an FTA assisted transit project may be considered an eligible expense as part of the project.  Exceptions to this include those situations where state and local law expressly prohibit the financing of such by the public entity.\n(2) Eligibility for FTA Assistance.  In order to qualify for FTA assistance, the recipient must execute an agreement for relocating or rearranging facilities with the entity responsible for the facilities, which agreement prescribes the procedures for the relocation and/or rearrangement of the facilities for the purpose of accommodating the construction of the federally assisted project.  Prior FTA approval is not required in reaching a utility relocation agreement.\n(3) Utility Relocation Agreement.  These agreements are distinguishable from third-party contracts in that only actual allowable, allocable, and reasonable costs are reimbursable.  When the work is to be performed by the public utility\u2019s forces, no profit is allowed, and reimbursement is limited to the amount necessary to relocate and/or rearrange the facilities to effect a condition equal to the existing utility facilities.  Generally, reimbursement will not provide for greater capacity, capability, durability, efficiency or function, or other betterments or enhancements to the existing utility system, except for meeting current state and local codes.  The indirect costs of governmental entities incurred under a utility relocation agreement are eligible for FTA reimbursement only in accordance with an approved Cost Allocation Plan (CAP) as prescribed in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E.\nd. Force Account.  Force account is the use of a recipient\u2019s labor force as a capital expense to carry out a capital project.  Force account work may consist of design, construction, overhaul, inspection, and construction management activities, if eligible for reimbursement as a capital expense under the Award.  Force account work does not include Award or project administration activities that are otherwise direct project costs.  Force account also does not include preventive maintenance or other items under the expanded definition of capital (e.g., security drills, mobility management) that are traditionally not a capital expense.  Incremental labor costs for flagging protection, service diversions, or other activities under FTA\u2019s expanded definition of capital also do not need to be included.  Based on the amount of Force Account work, recipients may be required to submit a justification to use force account and/or the Force Account Plan for FTA approval.    (1) Force account work less than $1,000,000 can be performed without justification or a force account plan.\n(2) Force account work $1,000,000 or greater but less than $10,000,000 requires submission of a force account justification prior to Award.  A recipient must maintain a force account plan in its files prior to incurring costs.\n(3) Force account work at $10,000,000 or greater requires submission of a force account justification, as well as prior FTA approval of the force account plan.\nNote that a force account plan is prepared at the project level; it, therefore, may cover multiple Grants, Cooperative Agreements, or Amendments thereto.  It may be prepared prior to or subsequent to Award, but must be in place before incurring costs.\n(4) Justification of Force Account work.  A justification to undertake force account work is required to use the recipient\u2019s own labor force greater than $1,000,000 on a project.  One of four conditions may warrant the use of force account work.  These are: (a) cost savings, (b) exclusive expertise, (c) safety and efficiency of operations, or (d) union agreement.  The justification must address at least one of the four criteria. a) Cost savings.\nThe justification documentation must include the following information to be justified based on cost savings:\n1 A comparison of the present worth of the estimated cash drawdown for both the force account and private sector contract options;\n2 The recipient should use the current interest rate paid on one-year Treasury Bills as the discount rate;\n3 The recipient should include the cost of preparing documents, cost of administration, and", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "d8fa140e-60df-420f-ab3d-c4ade22b7c7a"}, "4145725160918598074": {"text": " inspection, cost of labor, materials and specialized equipment, cost of overhead, and profit for private contract;\n4 Unit prices for labor; materials and equipment; overhead; and profit, if applicable for private contract;\n5 Certification that costs presented are fair and reasonable; and\n6 The present value calculation based on the midpoint of construction, and if the time for completion of the work differs for force account and a private sector contract, include an estimate of the cost of not using the completed improvement in the present worth calculation.  For example, if the work is to replace leased facilities, the cost of continuing the lease until the work is complete should be taken into account in the cost estimate for each option considered.\nb) Exclusive expertise.\nThe justification documentation must be based on exclusive expertise, and must include documentation equivalent to a sole source justification stating the basis for a determination that no private-sector contractor has the expertise to perform the work.\nc) Safety and efficiency of operations.\nThe justification documentation must include the following information to be justified based on safety and efficiency of operations:\n1 Safety considerations, which may be addressed by a statement of the transit operator\u2019s safety officer that performing the work with private-sector contractors would have an adverse effect on employee or public safety;\n2 Efficiency concerns, which may be addressed by a present worth calculation, including an estimate of the value of lost transit operation efficiency; and\n3 In emergency situations where the recipient uses its own workforce, the recipient may submit a waiver to the Emergency Relief docket.\nd) Union Agreement.\nThe justification documentation must include the information justified on the basis of a union agreement and must include relevant citations from labor union agreements and an analysis of how the agreements pertain to the work in question.\n(5) Force Account Plans.  Prior to incurring costs, a recipient must develop force account plans if it intends to use its own labor force in amounts greater than $1,000,000 on a project and retain the plan in its files.  If the amount is $10,000,000 or greater, the force account plan must be submitted to FTA for approval, including the following information and must be approved by FTA prior to incurring costs:  a) A description of the scope of work;\nb) A copy of the construction plans and specifications which includes a detailed estimate of costs and a detailed schedule and budget; and\nc) A copy of the proposed Agreement when another public agency is involved.\nSpecial care must be taken to ensure that requirements of 2 CFR part 200 are followed, especially for charging expendable property to force account projects and making sure that allowable costs are assigned to the correct activity codes.\nMost general purpose equipment and tools can be used in force account work and thereby benefit more than one project.  Therefore, the cost of these items normally should not be treated as a direct charge to the project.  However, an appropriate use or depreciation charge is an allowable indirect cost if otherwise provided for in the Award Budget.  Unusual circumstances may call for the purchase of specialized equipment that is unique to the force account work that is being performed.  If such equipment is required, prior FTA approval must be obtained.  The usual FTA equipment disposition requirements apply.\nThe progress and status of force account activities should be separately discussed in milestone/project reports, with emphasis on schedule and budget.\ne. Seismic Standards and Reporting.  New federally assisted buildings, and additions to existing buildings and bridges, built with federal assistance must be designed and constructed in accordance with state, local, and industry required standards or codes.  Before accepting delivery, the applicant is responsible for determining that the building complies with the seismic design and construction requirements and the recipient certifies to the same through the annual Certifications and Assurances, as required by 49 CFR part 41.\nf. Value Engineering.  Value Engineering (VE) is the systematic, multi-disciplined approach designed to optimize the value of each dollar spent.  To accomplish this goal, a team of architects/engineers identifies, analyzes, and establishes a value for a function of an item or system.  The objective of VE is to satisfy the required function at the lowest total costs (capital, operating, and maintenance) over the life of a project consistent with the requirements of performance, reliability, maintainability, safety, and aesthetics. (1) Applicability. a) Major Capital Projects.  VE must be used on major capital projects.  A major capital project is usually identified during the application process.  (See Chapter I, subsection a, \u201cDefinitions,\u201d for a definition of major capital project.)\nb) Non-Major Capital Projects.  Recipients are encouraged to conduct VE on all construction projects, including but not limited to bus maintenance and storage facilities, intermodal facilities, transfer facilities, railcar acquisition and rehabilitation, and offices, with the level of VE study to be commensurate with the size of the project.\n(2) Timing.  VE on a project should be performed early in the design process before major decisions have been completely incorporated into the design, at or near the end of project development.  Additional value engineering may be performed early in the engineering phase.  A VE study may not be needed for some project delivery methods such as design-build, if the bidders are required to provide the VE options (alternate concepts) as part of their proposals.  Some large or complex projects may need to conduct two VE studies.\ng. Reporting of Award Budget and Schedule.  Recipients with major capital projects are required to submit the following reports: (1) Project Budget and Schedule: Recipients of major capital projects must submit project budget and project schedule data to the FTA.  A major capital project is usually identified during the application process.  (See Chapter IV, subsection 5.b, \u201cProject Management Plan,\u201d for a definition of major capital project.)\n(2) Timing: Recipients with major capital projects are required to submit project budget and project schedule data at least once per quarter to the appropriate FTA Regional Office.  On limited basis, FTA may require a recipient to submit reports more frequently than quarterly.\n(3) Value Engineering Reports: Upon completion of a VE study on any major capital project, a recipient is required to submit the VE report to the appropriate FTA Regional Office.  Copies of the VE report form are available in each regional office.\nh. Constructability and Design Peer Reviews.  Peer review is a process used by the recipient in the planning, design, and implementation of capital projects.  The concept of peer review can be applied to any problem or situation where a second opinion can be useful to decision makers.  FTA encourages the recipient to confer with other transit operations and maintenance experts in order to benefit from their experience.  These reviews have been used to review rail extensions, New Starts projects, and transit facilities.  These reviews have provided an in-depth critique of designs at the preliminary and final engineering stages.  They have provided operations and maintenance information with respect to a variety of subsystems and have validated the process used by a recipient\u2019s planning staff to locate bus facilities.\nThe purpose of constructability and design peer reviews is to improve the performance of the process or product being reviewed and optimize the design and subsequent construction of the project.  The review should be able to answer such questions as: Can this be constructed? Is there a better process that could be employed to achieve the desired results? Is the product safe? Although the recipient is encouraged to conduct peer reviews with all capital projects, in some instances it may be required by FTA, and the process should be fully documented through the recipient\u2019s document control process.\ni. Crime Prevention and Security Review.  Recipients are encouraged to develop, refine, and conduct training on security and emergency response plans.  Emergency response drills should be conducted with public transportation agencies and be fully coordinated with local first response agencies.  Other security training should be provided for public transportation employees that will serve to prepare an agency better during an emergency including such things as bomb threats, detection of chemical and biological agents, and other disruptive incidents.  Recipients are encouraged to perform crime prevention reviews during the design phase of all federally assisted transit facilities with particular focus on the incorporation and use of crime prevention through environmental design techniques.\nThis review should serve to improve and increase the safety and security of an existing or planned transit system or facility for both transit patrons and transit employees.  The level of review should be commensurate with the project size and scope of work.  Local crime prevention professionals should be included in the review process.  Review documentation should remain on file by the recipient and be available for FTA review upon request.  Safety and security publications and training information can be found at\nwww.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/safety/transit-safety-oversight-tso and at safety.fta.dot.gov/cms/welcome.\nj. Concurrent Non-Project Activities.  Concurrent non-project activities, also known as betterments, are improvements to the transit project within an Award sought by the recipient that are not part of the base functioning of the federal transit Award.  They are not integral to the base functi", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "094fe840-74ed-4797-900f-d88bb3621481"}, "1281963208337746742": {"text": "oning of the Award and are viewed as enhancements or upgrades to a level beyond what is normally required for the base functioning of the transit Award.\nThe concurrent non-project activities are performed in conjunction with federally assisted work under the Award to afford the opportunity to have the non-project work performed economically and efficiently in conjunction with federally assisted project work.  Examples of betterments include increased utility pipe sizes, road widening projects for local reasons, environmental mitigation measures not identified in an environmental document, increased landscaping, signal upgrades beyond the base requirements of the transit project, etc.  Costs for concurrent non-project activities are to be paid for by the recipient.\nThese costs must be accounted for separately and reported to the FTA separately from the reporting requirements of the Award.  Related but different than concurrent non-project activities are activities involving an overbuild situation.  Guidance should be obtained\nfrom the FTA Regional Office related to any overbuild situation to determine the federal eligibility of such an activity.  An example of an over-build situation is over-designing the foundation and base stories of a multi-story facility in order to accommodate better future vertical expansion of the project.  Outside a joint development project, such an over-build is generally not an allowable cost.\nk. FTA Technical and Construction Oversight Review.  The recipient agrees to permit FTA to review, as FTA deems necessary, the technical plans and specifications of a project to ensure proper execution, consistency with the scope of work and need, and incorporation of FTA requirements.  The recipient agrees to comply with any FTA requests, including recommendations and determinations pertaining to its review of construction plans and specifications.  The FTA Regional Office should be consulted to determine if FTA review of construction plans and specifications is necessary to advance the project to the next level of design.  The recipient agrees to provide and maintain competent and adequate engineering supervision at the construction site to ensure that the completed work conforms to the plans and specifications and that the intent of the scope of work of the Award is carried out.  To the extent applicable, the recipient agrees to comply with FTA PMO regulations, 49 CFR part 633.\nl. Energy Conservation.  The recipient agrees to comply with applicable mandatory energy efficiency standards and policies of applicable state energy conservation plans issued in accordance with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321 et seq.  The recipient, to the extent applicable, agrees to perform an energy assessment for any building constructed, reconstructed, or modified with FTA assistance, as provided in FTA regulations, \u201cRequirements for Energy Assessments,\u201d 49 CFR part 622, subpart C.  FTA assistance for the construction, reconstruction, or modification of buildings for which applications are submitted to FTA will be approved only after the completion of an energy assessment.  An energy assessment shall consist of an analysis of the total energy requirements of a building, within the scope of work of the proposed construction activity and at a level commensurate with the project size and scope of work.  The energy assessment should consider overall design of the facility or modification, materials and techniques used in construction or rehabilitation, special innovative conservation features that may be used, fuel requirements for heating, cooling, and operations essential to the function of the structure, projected over the life of the facility and including projected costs of this fuel, and energy to be used.\nm. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS).  Recipients that have transportation projects that include ITS must be participants in a regional or statewide ITS Architecture process and their ITS projects must be included in the locally approved Regional ITS Architecture.  Recipients are required to use a Systems Engineering process for the development of ITS projects.\nThe project level requirements include undergoing a Systems Engineering Analysis for the ITS and communications components of the project or Award, and developing ITS Project Architectures for all major ITS projects (prior to the adoption of the regional ITS architecture).  The ITS components and FTA National ITS Architecture Consistency Policy for Transit Projects conformity status also should be included in applications for\nfederal assistance within FTA\u2019s electronic award management system.  The policy can be found at www.transit.dot.gov/research-innovation/national-its-architecture-consistency-policy-transit-projects.\nA systems engineering analysis is a \u201cstructured process for arriving at a final design of a system,\u201d and is a method for identifying needs and developing/procuring the best possible configuration for a particular situation.  The policy requires that the systems engineering analysis includes how the project fits into the regional (or national) ITS architecture, how the system will be implemented and operated (roles, requirements), and analyses of alternatives for system configuration, financing, and procurement.  Applicable (DOT-developed and supported) ITS standards also must be identified.\nPrior to the adoption of a regional ITS architecture, all Awards with major ITS projects must also include the development of a project level architecture.  Major ITS projects are any projects that implement part of a regional ITS initiative that is multi-jurisdictional, multi-modal, or otherwise affects regional integration of ITS systems.  Examples include regional traveler information, regional electronic payment, new AVL systems that may set the standard for the region, or transit signal priority systems.  A project architecture is similar to a regional ITS architecture but focuses on the project and its implementation.  Again, all agreements that are needed to implement and operate the ITS systems must be included as part of the project architecture.\nn. $1 Coin Requirements.  The recipient agrees that its equipment and facilities will be fully capable of accepting and dispensing $1 coins when coins or currency are required to use that equipment or those facilities, and that the recipient will display signs and notices of the $1 coin capability.\no. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  New facilities, vehicles, and additions and/or alterations to existing facilities and vehicles are required to comply with regulations issued by DOT implementing the transportation provisions of ADA (49 CFR parts 27, 37, 38, and 39).  Recipients are advised to consult appropriate FTA circulars, DOT guidance, and other official federal guidance.  Any new construction or alteration to a facility built after the enactment of the ADA must comply with all ADA requirements.  Alterations to pre-ADA facilities are required to include improvements to facility accessibility, to varying extents.  Recipients should consult with the applicable regional office and Office of Civil Rights to determine the requirements for accessibility improvements for alterations to pre-ADA facilities.  Compliance is a condition of eligibility for federal assistance required by 49 CFR part 27, and is required whether or not the facility or alteration is federally assisted.  Depending upon the nature of the facility, compliance with implementing regulations issued by other federal agencies with ADA responsibilities may also be required.  The applicant is responsible for ensuring that new facilities, vehicles and additions/alterations to existing facilities and vehicles are designed in accordance with DOT and ADA regulations and related guidance in effect as of the date construction begins and for verifying compliance prior to accepting delivery.\nFTA OVERSIGHT\n1. GENERAL.  The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) evaluates recipient adherence to program and administrative requirements through a comprehensive oversight program.  FTA\u2019s Master Agreement, which is made available to each recipient through FTA\u2019s Web site (www.transit.dot.gov/), specifies these requirements.  FTA determines compliance through self-certification, oversight review, audits, and site visits.\n2. PROGRAM OVERSIGHT.    a. Comprehensive Reviews.  FTA\u2019s comprehensive oversight reviews take a broad look at its recipients\u2019 management practices as well as compliance with program and administrative requirements across a broad spectrum of topic areas in accordance with 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.  In addition to helping evaluate grantees, these reviews give FTA an opportunity to provide technical assistance for meeting FTA requirements and aid FTA in reporting to the Secretary, Congress, other oversight agencies, and the transit community on FTA programs.\nFederal law requires the FTA to review recipients of Section 5307 funds at least every three years.  Known as the Triennial Review, these comprehensive reviews allow FTA to meet its statutory obligation to review and evaluate recipients by looking at compliance across a variety of topic areas including financial management and capacity, technical capacity, maintenance, procurement, civil rights, and others.  For recipients of federal funds through programs other than Section 5307, including Sections 5309, 5310, 5311, 5329, 5339, and other sections of 49 U.S.C. chapter 53, the FTA conducts comprehensive oversight reviews following a similar format to the Triennial Review.\nb. Specialized Reviews.  In addition to comprehensive oversight reviews, FTA conducts specialized oversight reviews.  Specialized reviews can occur within the context of a comprehensive review or as a separate review.  Major topic areas for specialized reviews include, but are not limited to, procurement, financial management, and civil rights.\n(1) Procurement.  Procurement fo", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "b83006b5-114a-445d-8682-75cc3eb26010"}, "6336143938807065636": {"text": "cused reviews ensure that recipients are meeting the third-party procurement requirements and standards of the Uniform Administrative Requirements, 2 CFR part 1201 (which incorporates 2 CFR part 200 by reference).  Additional information on procurement requirements and standards can be found in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 4220.1, \u201cThird-party Contracting Guidance.\u201d\n(2) Financial Management.  Financial management reviews assess recipients\u2019 financial management and control systems as well as policies and procedures.  Full Scope of Work System Reviews determine whether the recipient has proper financial controls and checks and balances in place to manage and track federal funds and meet the requirements of the DOT\u2019s Common Rule, 2 CFR part 1201 (which\nincorporates 2 CFR part 200 by reference).  Financial Condition and Capability Assessments assess a recipient\u2019s financial condition and capability to maintain and operate the existing system.\n(3) Civil Rights.  Recipients and subrecipients of federal assistance must comply with Federal Civil Rights requirements under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, DOT regulations concerning participation by Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE), Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) requirements, and the transportation provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).  The FTA Office of Civil Rights conducts periodic reviews to ensure ongoing compliance with these requirements so that recipients and subrecipients may remain eligible for federal financial assistance.  FTA recipients should be aware, however, that they may be subject to civil rights requirements established and enforced by federal agencies other than FTA or DOT, and that some of these responsibilities exist independent of FTA or other federal funding.   a) Title VI Reviews.  Title VI prohibits discrimination by recipients of federal assistance on the basis of race, color, and national origin, including the denial of meaningful access for limited English proficient (LEP) persons.  The FTA Office of Civil Rights reviews recipients of FTA assistance to determine their compliance with Title VI, the DOT implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 21, and the Title VI program-specific guidance in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 4702.1.  This includes a review of the recipient\u2019s service standards and policies, public outreach efforts, process for conducting service and fare equity analyses, LEP compliance, and other efforts.\nb) DBE Reviews.  Under 49 CFR \u00a7 26.21(a)(2), each FTA recipient must have a DBE program if it receives planning, capital, and/or operating assistance, and will award prime contracts with a cumulative total value exceeding $250,000 in FTA funds in a federal fiscal year (excluding transit vehicle purchases).  The FTA Office of Civil Rights reviews recipients of FTA assistance to determine their compliance with 49 CFR part 26.  This includes a review of the recipient\u2019s triennial DBE goal, overall DBE program, transit-vehicle purchases, certification processes, and contract monitoring.\nc) EEO Reviews.  FTA recipients are required to have EEO programs in place to prevent discrimination against their employees or applicants for employment because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or age.  The FTA Office of Civil Rights reviews recipients of FTA assistance to determine their compliance with related federal transit laws (for example, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332(b)) and FTA\u2019s EEO Circular 4704.1.  This includes assessing a recipient\u2019s employment practices and policies, designation of EEO responsibilities, employment statistics and workforce analyses, and monitoring of EEO efforts.\nd) ADA Reviews.  The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability.  FTA is responsible for ensuring that providers of public transportation are in\ncompliance with the DOT regulations implementing the transportation provisions of the ADA, 49 CFR parts 27, 37, 38, and 39, which govern the design, construction, alteration and maintenance of transportation facilities; the design, acquisition, and maintenance of vehicles; and the operation of transportation services.  These requirements are further addressed in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 4710.1.\nThe FTA Office of Civil Rights conducts periodic compliance reviews of FTA recipients with regard to the following:\n1 Rail stations (key stations, new construction, and alterations to existing stations);\n2 Fixed-route service (stop announcements and lift and ramp maintenance); and\n3 Complementary paratransit (eligibility and service requirements).\n3. SAFETY OVERSIGHT.\nFTA is required under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5329 to establish a comprehensive public transportation safety program.\nPursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5329(f), the U.S. Secretary of Transportation is authorized to take actions to evaluate and direct changes in a recipient\u2019s performance of operations in order to improve the safety of public transportation systems.  The extent of these authorities and actions includes: (1) conducting inspections, investigations, audits, examinations, and testing of the equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations of the recipient\u2019s public transportation system, (2) making reports and issuing directives with respect to the safety of the recipient\u2019s public transportation system, and (3) issuing a subpoena to and taking the deposition of any employee of a recipient or State Safety Oversight Agency in conjunction with an accident investigation or an investigation into a pattern or practice of conduct that negatively affects public safety.\nPursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5329(g), the Secretary is authorized to issue directives, to require more frequent oversight of a recipient by a State Safety Oversight Agency or the Secretary, to impose more frequent reporting requirements, and to require that any federal financial assistance provided under 49 U.S.C. chapter 53 be spent on correcting safety deficiencies identified by the Secretary or the State Safety Oversight Agency.\nThe specific safety reviews are discussed below:\na. Drug and Alcohol Program Compliance Audits.  The purpose of the Drug and Alcohol Testing Program is to help prevent accidents, fatalities, and injuries resulting from the misuse of alcohol or the use of prohibited drugs by employees who perform safety-sensitive functions.  Establishing a testing program is a condition of federal assistance appropriated or made available for 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5307, 5309, 5311, 5339, or other programs as designated by the Secretary and any contractor of a recipient or subrecipient\nunder 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5307, 5309, 5311, 5339, or other program as designated by the Secretary.  For noncompliance with 49 CFR parts 40 and 655, the Secretary may bar a recipient from receiving FTA assistance in an amount that the Secretary deems appropriate.\nRecipients must certify annually that they are in compliance with DOT and FTA regulations concerning drug and alcohol testing, 49 CFR parts 40 and 655 respectively.\nFTA conducts audits of recipients and states to assess their implementation of 49 CFR part 655 requirements.  These audits provide in-depth reviews of recipient and state programs, and include a detailed examination of records and interviews with appropriate recipient personnel, their contractors, service agents such as employees of collection sites, medical review officers, substance abuse professionals, and third-party administrators.  FTA assigns staff and contractor support to audit recipients\u2019 drug and alcohol testing programs.  FTA uses data collected and analyzed from the Drug and Alcohol Management Information System (DAMIS) to assess and monitor recipients\u2019 programs.  FTA monitors industry drug and alcohol testing rates and results.  These audits are scheduled based on analysis of DAMIS information and annual recipient evaluation.  FTA manages this program using a Web-based auditing and reporting system.\nb. State Safety Oversight Program Audit.  FTA is required to monitor and evaluate compliance with FTA\u2019s State Safety Oversight Rule, 49 CFR part 659 and/or part 674.  FTA conducts triennial audits of each state oversight agency designated to implement FTA\u2019s State Safety Oversight Rule for the rail transit agencies operating in its jurisdiction.  For each audit, FTA assigns its own staff, plus contractor support, to review each state\u2019s program.  These audits are scheduled based on analyses of annual reporting information provided by the states and use the recipient assessment.  These audits provide in-depth reviews of each state\u2019s program, and include a detailed examination of records and interviews with appropriate personnel and their contractors, at both the state oversight agency and the regulated rail transit agencies.  The audits also provide a forum to recommend improvements to the effectiveness of the oversight program established by each state.\nc. FTA Voluntary Bus Transit Safety and Security Reviews.  To implement the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement signed by FTA, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the American Public Transportation Association, and the Community Transportation Association of America, FTA conducts voluntary safety and security reviews at bus agencies throughout the country.  These reviews assess each bus agency\u2019s safety and security activities against FTA\u2019s technical assistance baseline, and provide recommendations, effective practices, and model materials to support improvements in critical safety and security functions.  The Transit Bus Safety and Security Program is based on objectives designed to improve safety and security for passengers, employees, and others that share the roadways with America\u2019s urban and rural public transit bus operations.  The Program encompasses public transit bus agencies of all sizes, including urban, small urban, rural, tribal, and community transit, and FTA is committed to the broadest possible implementation of Program", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "a3106fe3-2a5e-4274-a4a6-21fcf33720ba"}, "7429337956567712046": {"text": " strategies and tools.\n4. PROJECT OVERSIGHT.    a. Capital Program Management Reviews (1) Cost, Scope of Work, Schedule, Project Management Plan and Technical Capacity, and Capability Reviews and Risk Assessments.  Some of the key activities that FTA performs include cost review, scope of work review, schedule review, project management plan review, and review of the management capacity and capability of the project sponsor, or recipient.  Several other reviews may be conducted based on the project requirements.  The reviews are generally based on the complexity of the project, the project sponsor\u2019s experience, the cost of the project, and/or a risk-based approach.\n(2) Project Management Oversight (PMO) Reviews.  FTA conducts PMO reviews for major capital projects.  The primary goal of FTA\u2019s PMO reviews is to ensure that the project sponsors, or recipients, have all the necessary processes and procedures in place to effectively manage and deliver the promised benefits of the project on time, within budget, and in compliance with all applicable federal requirements and the project management plan.  PMOC Contractors will, generally, undertake a quarterly project site visit unless concerns with implementing the project management plan results in budget or schedule risk arise.\n(3) Quarterly Project Management Meetings.  Quarterly project management meetings, between FTA staff and project sponsors, or recipients, may be instituted with selected recipients.  These meetings provide a forum for management briefings, status/progress reports, discussion of accomplishments and problems, and, as appropriate, an opportunity for site inspection.\n(4) Site Visits.  FTA may conduct on-site inspections of projects to evaluate the recipient\u2019s effectiveness in implementing the project in conformance with the Grant Agreement, Cooperative Agreement, or other agreement.  Inspection visits may be made, for example, to follow up on information received from the recipient about an event with significant impact on a project or to determine whether the recipient has adequately complied with civil rights laws, regulations, and agreements.  Inspection and concurrence by FTA in project work does not relieve the recipient of its responsibilities and liabilities as the responsible party for carrying out the project.  The meetings do not replace quarterly written reports, unless FTA grants a specific exemption.\nNote: As a result of its monitoring efforts or those of its designated agents, FTA may determine that a recipient requires additional or specialized oversight to address identified or potential programmatic, administrative, or financial concerns.  Supplemental oversight may also include the imposition of additional conditions on the Award or monitoring requirements.\nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT\n1. GENERAL.  This chapter discusses the proper use and management of federal assistance the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) expects its recipients to adopt and use.  Financial management is one of the most important practices in the management of federal assistance.\n2. INTERNAL CONTROLS.      a. Internal control means a process, implemented by a recipient or subrecipient, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories: (1) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (2) reliability of reporting for internal and external use, and (3) compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nb. Internal Control Over Compliance Requirements for the Federal Award means a process implemented by a non-federal entity designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the following objectives for federal Awards:  (1) Transactions are conducted in compliance with:  a) Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the federal award that could have a direct and material effect on a federal program, and\nb) Any other federal statutes and regulations that are identified in the OMB Compliance Supplement.\n(2) Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition.\n(3) Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in order to:  a) Permit the preparation of reliable financial statements and federal reports,\nb) Maintain accountability over assets, and\nc) Demonstrate compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the federal Award.\nc. General.  FTA payments to a recipient are made electronically to meet the federal share of eligible expenses incurred under the Award.\nThe recipient\u2019s execution of its FTA Grant or Cooperative Agreement requires the recipient to use the federal assistance it receives as specified in that Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  This creates a vested interest by the Federal Government in unused balances, any improperly used federal assistance, and facilities, equipment, or services purchased\nor otherwise acquired to implement its Award, whether the federal assistance received by the recipient is an advance or reimbursement.\nRecipients and subrecipients are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over all their functions that affect implementation of the Award.\nFor proper management of the Award, these controls must be used by each recipient in all its operating, accounting, financial, and administrative systems.  To ensure proper accountability for federal assistance, internal controls must be integrated with the management systems used by the recipient to regulate and guide its operations.\nd. Objectives.  Resources must be used in accordance with applicable state, local, and federal laws, regulations and policies, and the Grant or Cooperative Agreement accompanying the Award.  Resources must be safeguarded against waste, loss, and misuse.  Reliable data on resource use and safeguards must be accumulated, maintained, and fairly disclosed in reports to the recipient\u2019s management and FTA.  A proper system of internal controls will help the recipient to:  (1) Operate efficiently and economically;\n(2) Keep obligations and costs within the limits of authorizations and legal requirements, consistent with accomplishing the purpose of the Award;\n(3) Safeguard assets against waste, loss, and misuse;\n(4) Ensure timely collection and proper accounting of the recipient\u2019s operating and other revenues; and\n(5) Ensure accuracy and reliability in financial, statistical, and other reports.\ne. Necessary Elements.  Certain elements are necessary to achieve the objectives mentioned above in Chapter VI, subsection 2.d and meet the standards discussed below in Chapter VI, subsection 2.f.  The following objectives and standards facilitate the recipient\u2019s use of internal controls:  (1) Reasonable assurance that internal controls are an integral part of the recipient\u2019s management systems;\n(2) Existence of a positive and supportive attitude among the recipient\u2019s managers and employees;\n(3) Assignment of internal control functions to competent and experienced employees;\n(4) Identification of specific internal control objectives to ensure that needs are identified and that valid controls are planned and implemented;\n(5) Adoption of internal control policies, plans, and procedures that reasonably ensure their effectiveness, such as organizational separation of duties and physical arrangements, such as locks and fire alarms; and\n(6) Regular program of testing to identify vulnerabilities in the internal control system.\nf. Standards of Internal Control and Audit Resolutions.    (1) General.   a) Recipient management policies that govern implementation of the Award must be clearly stated, understood throughout the organization, and conformed to applicable legislative and administrative requirements.\nb) The recipient\u2019s formal organization structure must clearly define, assign, and delegate appropriate authority for all duties.\nc) Responsibility for duties and functions must be segregated within the organization to ensure that adequate internal checks and balances exist.  Recipients should pay particular attention to authorization, performance, recording, inventory control, and review functions to reduce the opportunity for unauthorized or fraudulent acts.\nd) A system of organizational planning should exist to determine financial, property, and personnel resource needs.\ne) Written operating procedures must exist and be simply stated, yet meet the recipient\u2019s operating, legal, and regulatory requirements.  In developing its procedures, the recipient should consider such factors as feasibility, cost, risk of loss or error, and availability of suitable personnel; other important considerations are the prevention of illegal or unauthorized transactions or acts.\nf) The recipient\u2019s information system must reliably provide needed operating and financial data for decision-making and performance review.\ng) The recipient must provide proper supervision and performance must be subject to review of an effective internal audit program.\nh) All personnel must be properly qualified for their assigned responsibilities, duties, and functions; education, training, experience, competence, and integrity should be considered in assigning work; all must be held fully accountable for the proper discharge of their assignments.\ni) Expenditures must be controlled so that construction, equipment, other property, and services are acquired and received as contracted for (as to quality, quantity, price, and time of delivery); authorizations for expenditures must conform to applicable statutes, regulations, and policies.\nj) All real property, equipment, expendables, and funds must be safeguarded to prevent misuse, misappropriation, waste, or unwarranted deterioration or destruction.\n(2) Internal Control Self-Assessment.  The recipient should evaluate its internal controls and financial management systems to ensure their effectiveness.  To assist with the evaluation, FTA developed an example of an Internal Contr", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "86d0e147-0cd5-4532-bcfd-bd294ecb5492"}, "7851245905390285057": {"text": "ol Self-Assessment Form.  The optional form is designed to provide the recipient\u2019s management staff with the information necessary to evaluate the agency\u2019s internal control and financial management system.  The form is based on the criteria for effective internal control as set forth in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Committee (the COSO Report), as well as the criteria for effective financial management systems established by FTA, based on U.S. DOT\u2019s common rules at 2 CFR \u00a7 200.518, effective on and after December 26, 2014 and former 49 CFR parts 18 and 19 in effect before December 26, 2014.\nThe Internal Control Self-Assessment Tool can be found at:  https://ecihstp.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/05/16.-Internal-Control-Self-Assessment-Tool.pdf\n(3) Financial Management Systems.    a) States: A state must expend and account for the federal assistance it awarded in accordance with state laws and procedures for expending and accounting for the state\u2019s own funds.  In addition, the financial management systems of a state, recipient, or subrecipient, including records documenting compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions applicable to the Award, must be sufficient to:  1 Permit preparation of reports required by the general and program-specific terms and conditions, and\n2 Permit the tracing of federal assistance to a level of expenditures adequate to establish that such federal assistance has been used according to the federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Award.\nb) Entities Other than a State: The financial management systems of each recipient or subrecipient other than a state must meet the following standards:  1 Financial Reporting.  Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of federally assisted activities must be made in accordance with financial reporting requirements.\n2 Accounting Records.  Recipients and subrecipients must maintain records that adequately identify the source and application of funds provided for federally assisted activities.  These records must contain information pertaining to the Award or subawards and authorizations, obligations,\nunobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or expenditures, and income.\n3 Internal Control.  Effective control and accountability must be maintained for all cash provided to support the Award or subaward, real and personal property, and other assets; recipients and subrecipients must adequately safeguard all such property and must ensure that it is used solely for authorized purposes.\n4 Budget Control.  Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared with budgeted amounts for each Award or subaward.  Financial information must be related to performance or productivity data, including the development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or specifically required in the Grant or Cooperative Agreement or written agreement with the subrecipient.  If the unit cost data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be accepted whenever possible.\n5 Allowable Cost.  Applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) cost principles of 2 CFR part 200 for Awards made on or after December 26, 2014, and OMB cost principles for Awards made before December 26, 2014, as stated in former 2 CFR parts 220, 225, and 230, as applicable.  U.S. DOT program regulations, and the terms of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement or other written agreement with the subrecipient, must be followed in allowability and allocability of costs.\n6 Source Documentation.  Accounting records must be supported by such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, time and attendance records, contracts, and subrecipient documents.\n7 Cash Management.  Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the Treasury and disbursement by recipients and subrecipients must be followed whenever advance payment procedures are used.  Recipients must establish reasonable procedures to ensure the reports on subrecipients\u2019 cash balances and cash disbursements are received in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency.  When advances are made by electronic transfer of funds methods, the recipient must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of making disbursements.  Recipients must monitor cash drawdowns by their recipients to ensure that they conform substantially to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to advances to recipients.  Payment received from FTA must be disbursed within three business days.  If not disbursed within three days, funds become excess funds and must be returned to FTA with interest.\n3. NON-FEDERAL SHARE.  The recipient agrees to provide sufficient funds or approved in-kind resources to serve as non-federal share for all of its federally assisted Awards in compliance with 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.  The recipient certifies that it has or will have available the proportionate amount of the non-federal share to pay promptly the costs incurred or that become due to implement the Award, except to the extent that the Federal Government determines in writing that the non-federal share may be deferred.  The recipient may not use an amount as the non-federal share for more than one Award.\nDepending on the source of FTA funding, the non-federal share may include:\na. Cash from nongovernmental sources other than revenues from providing public transportation services;\nb. Non-farebox revenues from the operation of public transportation service, such as the sale of advertising and concession revenues (a voluntary or mandatory fee that a college, university, or similar institution imposes on all its students for free or discounted transit service is not farebox revenue);\nc. Assets from other federal sources if authorized by federal law to be used as non-federal share for the specific project;\nd. Amounts received under a service agreement with a state or local social service agency or private social service organization; and\ne. Undistributed cash surpluses, replacement or depreciation cash funds, reserves available in cash, or new capital.\nNote: Recipients should consult the applicable program circular to determine what sources of non-federal share are permitted for any particular activity.\n4. FINANCIAL PLAN.  Upon request from FTA, the recipient agrees to provide a financial plan delineating the source of non-federal share, the amounts applicable to the different sources, and the time frame for acquisition of the non-federal share.  Recipients must have multi-year financial plans (3\u20135 years) for operating and capital revenues and expenses to implement FTA Awards.  The financial plans should indicate adequate revenues to maintain and operate the existing system and to complete the annual program of projects (POP).\n5. FEDERAL PRINCIPLES FOR DETERMINING ALLOWABLE COSTS.     a. General.   (1) Recipients should refer to DOT regulations, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d 2 CFR part 1201, for Awards and amendments thereto with additional funding made on or after December 26, 2014, to Awards and amendments.\n(2) Recipients of Award made before December 26, 2014, should refer to former 2 CFR part 220 (OMB Circular A-21, \u201cCost Principles for Educational\nInstitutions\u201d); former 2 CFR part 225 (OMB Circular A-87, \u201cCost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments\u201d); former 2 CFR part 230 (OMB Circular A-122, \u201cCost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations\u201d); or the Federal Acquisition Regulations subpart 31.2 (48 CFR chapter I, subpart 31.2), which covers for-profit organizations.  While there are a few substantive differences between the new cost principles of 2 CFR part 200 and the former OMB cost principles, the differences are explained in the following OMB \u201ccrosswalk\u201d documents:  a) \u201cUniform Guidance Crosswalk from Final Guidance to Existing Guidance,\u201d A-21, A-50, A-87, A-89, A-102, A-110, A-122, A-133, www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/fedreg/2013/uniform-guidance-crosswalk-to-predominate-source-existing-guidance.pdf, and\nb) \u201cUniform Guidance Crosswalk from Existing Guidance to Final Guidance,\u201d www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/fedreg/2013/uniform-guidance-crosswalk-from-predominate-source-in-existing-guidance.pdf.\n(3) Apart from the cost differences identified above, FTA has determined that: a) The Program Income provisions of 2 CFR \u00a7 1201.80 supersede conflicting provisions of the Program Income provisions of 2 CFR \u00a7 200.80.  In addition, the profit provisions of the latest Master Agreement supersede the prohibition on profits of 2 CFR \u00a7 200.400(g).\nb) Project costs must specifically relate to the purpose of the Award and the latest Award Budget.  Recipients may incur direct and indirect costs.  Direct costs are costs that can be identified specifically with a particular cost objective and may be charged directly to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  All direct costs, even for project administration activities, must be adequately supported with proper documentation.  For example, all labor charges must be supported with T&A records.  Indirect costs are costs incurred for a common or joint purpose benefiting more than one cost objective.  Indirect costs must be supported by an approved Cost Allocation Plan (CAP) and/or Indirect Cost Rate Proposal (ICRP).\nc) Care must be exercised when incurring costs to ensure that all expenditures meet the criteria of eligible costs.  Failure to exercise proper discretion may result in expenditures for which the use of project funds cannot be authorized.  The guidelines contained in this document are general guidelines for determining allowable costs, and any program-specific guidelines take precedence over what is presented here.  Please refer to your specif", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "6f29b834-d280-4257-8aab-049b5903f333"}, "794427843001399304": {"text": "ic program\u2019s guidance and circulars for more information.\nb. Allowable Costs.  The criteria that govern the eligibility of costs to implement the Award are listed below.  To be allowable under a federal assistance program, costs must meet the following general criteria:  (1) Be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient administration of the federal assistance program, be allowable under the principles contained in the OMB common rules and circulars and except as specifically provided in this circular, not be general expenses required to carry out the overall responsibilities of state or local governments.\n(2) Be authorized or not prohibited under state or local laws or regulations.\n(3) Be able to conform to any limitation or exclusions set forth in the principles, federal laws, or other governing limitations as to types or amounts of cost items.\n(4) Be consistent with policies, regulations, and procedures that apply uniformly to both federally assisted and other activities of the unit of government of which recipient is a part.\n(5) Be treated consistently.  A cost may not be assigned to its Award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been allocated to the Award as an indirect cost.\n(6) Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) appropriate to the circumstances.\n(7) Not be allocable to or included as a cost of any other federally assisted program in either current or prior periods.\n(8) Be net of all applicable credits.\n(9) Be adequately documented.\n(10) Not be incurred before its Award is made unless specifically provided for in a Letter of No Prejudice (LONP) or equivalent document approved by FTA, or in the pre-award authority as described in the Federal Register listing of the Annual Apportionments.\nc. Disallowed Costs.  In determining the amount of federal assistance FTA will provide, FTA will exclude:  (1) Any costs to implement the Award incurred by the recipient before the date of the Award, unless specifically provided for in a LONP or equivalent document approved by FTA, or in the pre-award authority as described in the Federal Register listing of the Annual Apportionments; and\n(2) Any costs attributable to property or services received under a contract or other arrangement that is required to be, but has not been, concurred in or approved in writing by FTA.\nThe recipient agrees that reimbursement of any cost in accordance with the indicated payment methods for its Award does not constitute a final FTA decision about the allowability of that cost and does not constitute a waiver of any violation by the recipient of the terms of its Award.  If the Federal Government determines that the recipient is not entitled to receive any part of the federal assistance requested, the Federal Government will notify the recipient stating the reasons.  Closeout of the Award will not alter the recipient\u2019s obligation to return any federal assistance due to FTA as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions.  Nor will closeout of the Award alter FTA\u2019s right to disallow costs and recover federal assistance on the basis of a later audit or other review.  Unless prohibited by law, FTA may offset any federal assistance to be made available under its Award necessary to satisfy any outstanding monetary claims that FTA may have against the recipient.  Exceptions pertaining to disallowed costs are set forth in FTA directives or in other written federal guidance.\n6. INDIRECT COSTS.     a. General.  Recipients that intend to seek payment for indirect costs must prepare a Cost Allocation Plan (CAP) or an Indirect Cost Rate Proposal (ICRP).  CAPs and Indirect Cost Rate Proposals must be approved by FTA or another cognizant federal agency.  Pursuant to 2 CFR \u00a7 200.210, a Federal Award must include identification of the indirect cost rate for the Federal award (including if the de minimis rate is charged).\nb. Definitions.  Indirect costs, as defined in 2 CFR part 200, are costs that are:  (1) Incurred for a common or joint purpose benefiting more than one cost objective,\n(2) Not readily assignable to the cost objectives specifically benefited, without effort disproportionate to the results achieved, and\n(3) Originating in the recipient department as well as those incurred by other departments in supplying goods, services, and facilities to the recipient department.\nExamples of indirect costs are administrative, operational, and expenses of unit heads and their immediate staff.  Principles and standards for determining costs applicable to Grants and Cooperative Agreements with recipient or other state or local government authorities are presented in 2 CFR part 200.416 and the appropriate Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) publication, ASMB C-10 (Cost Principles and Procedures for Establishing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government).\nc. Cognizant Federal Agency.  Cognizance is generally assigned to the federal agency that provides the predominant amount of federal funding with a recipient within a given state or locality.  (OMB has assigned cognizant audit agencies for state and local governments.)\nCognizant agency for indirect costs means the federal agency responsible for reviewing, negotiating, and approving indirect cost proposals or cost allocation plans developed under 2 CFR part 200 on behalf of all federal agencies.  Cognizance is generally assigned\nto the federal age ncy that provides the predominant amount of dollar involvement with a recipient organization.  Once designated as the cognizant agency for indirect costs, the federal agency must remain so for a period of 5 years.  (The cognizant agency for indirect costs is not necessarily the same as the cognizant agency for audit.) OMB has assigned cognizant audit agencies for state and local governments. The U.S. DOT is the cognizant agency for determining indirect costs for state and local airport and port authorities and transit districts.\nIn those cases in which a recipient is not assigned a cognizant agency, that recipient will be under the general oversight of the federal agency that provides it the most direct federal funds, which will also be identified as the cognizant agency for indirect costs.\nd. Plans and Proposals.    (1) The CAP is a plan that distributes the costs of a state or local government\u2019s executive and central level support functions to those operating organizations (usually at a lower tier level) within the government that benefit from them.  These documents are also referred to as a statewide cost allocation plans (SWCAP) or local-wide cost allocation plans (LWCAP).  All SWCAPs must be submitted annually to DHHS for approval.  DHHS is the cognizant agency for all states.  Unless required by FTA, or the cognizant agency, the local governments claiming central services costs do not have to receive federal approval.  Each major local government is also required to submit a plan to its cognizant agency for indirect costs annually.  All other local governments claiming central service costs must develop a plan and maintain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit.  These local governments are not required to submit their plans for federal approval, unless they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.  The costs approved under these plans may, at the option of the state or local government, be incorporated into the Indirect Cost Rate Proposals of a recipient agency within the government.  See Appendix F, Cost Allocation Plans, for further information.\n(2) The Indirect Cost Rate Proposal, which is a financial document that is updated annually at the operating agency level and which distributes the administrative support and/or overhead costs of that agency to the programs (and the Grants and Cooperative Agreements thereunder) that benefit from them.  An Indirect Cost Rate Proposal may include the allocable portion of state or local central service costs approved in the SWCAP/LWCAP.  See Appendix G, Indirect Cost Rate Proposals, for further information.\nRequirements for development and submission of indirect cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans are contained in Appendices III\u2013VII and Appendix IX of 2 CFR part 200, as follows:\na) Appendix III to 2 CFR part 200\u2014Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs);\nb) Appendix IV to 2 CFR part 200\u2014Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations;\nc) Appendix V to 2 CFR part 200\u2014State/Local Government-wide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans;\nd) Appendix VI to 2 CFR part 200\u2014Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans;\ne) Appendix VII to 2 CFR part 200\u2014States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals; and\nf) Appendix IX to 2 CFR part 200\u2014Hospital Cost Principles.\nRefer to Appendix G of this circular regarding additional information on Indirect Cost Rate Proposals and Appendix F for CAP information.\ne. Reporting Indirect Expenses.  If a recipient is charging indirect costs to its Award, the recipient must include the status of expenditures when completing its reporting requirements (quarterly, monthly, or annual, as applicable).  The information listed below must be provided in reports as expenses incurred on a cumulative basis.\nThe type of plan and rate must be consistent with the approved cost allocation plan on file, as approved by the cognizant agency, or as otherwise approved by FTA that permits reimbursement of these expenses.  The recipient should report expenses that are consistent with the rate indicated at the time of application and reflected in the FFR (See Appendix B for more detailed information and guidance on Federal Financial Reports.  See Appendix F for more detailed information on Cost Allocation Plans and Appendix G for more", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "688e1e1a-b50b-4c77-bb2e-69fb42173e93"}, "214546619385524040": {"text": " detailed information on Indirect Cost Rate Proposals).\nThe information to be reported is:\n(1) Type \u2013 Enter indirect expense type (e.g., provisional or fixed);\n(2) Rate \u2013 The rate approved by the cognizant agency;\n(3) Base \u2013 The total base amount from which the indirect cost rate is determined;\n(4) Period from / Period to \u2013 The period covered by the approved rate;\n(5) Amount Charged \u2013 The total amount of indirect expenses charged to the Award on a cumulative basis; and\n(6) Federal Share \u2013 The federal share of the indirect expenses charged.\n7. PROGRAM INCOME.     a. General.  Recipients are encouraged to earn income to defray program costs where appropriate.\nFTA\u2019s program income policy for state, local governments, Indian tribes, and for institutions of higher learning and nonprofit organizations are at 2 CFR \u00a7 200.307 as modified by 2 CFR \u00a7 1201.80.  The \u201cProgram Income\u201d provisions of 2 CFR \u00a7 1201.80 supersede the \u201cProgram Income\u201d provisions of 2 CFR \u00a7 200.80, and as further described in the latest FTA Master Agreement.  FTA recognizes program income to be gross income (minus the cost of generating program income) earned by the recipient, or subrecipient, that is directly generated by a supported activity, or earned only as a result of the federal Award during the period of performance, per 2 CFR \u00a7 200.77.  The federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must include start and end dates of the period of performance in its Award.\nb. Program Income includes, but is not limited to, the following income:  (1) Fees for services performed;\n(2) The use or rental of real or personal property acquired under its Award;\n(3) The sale of commodities or items fabricated under its Award;\n(4) License fees and royalties on patents and copyrights;\n(5) Advertising/concessions specifically required by the federal Award, and pertaining to specific activities or accomplishments which result from performance of the federal Award; or\n(6) Payments of principal and interest on loans made with federal assistance.\nInterest earned on advances of federal assistance is NOT program income.  Except as otherwise provided in federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the federal Award, program income does not include rebates, credits, discounts, taxes, special assessments, levies, and fines raised by a recipient and subrecipient, and interest earned on any of them.\nc. Cost of Generating Program Income.  In determining the total amount of program income a Recipient has earned from its Project, those costs incident to earning program income that have not been charged to the Award may be deducted from the Recipient\u2019s gross income.\nd. Governmental Revenues.  Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and other such revenues raised by a recipient or subrecipient are not program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the Award, documents incorporated by reference into the Award, or federal awarding agency regulations as program income.\ne. Property.  Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment are not program income.  Such proceeds will be handled in accordance with the requirements of 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, \u201cPost Federal Award Requirements, Property Standards,\u201d 2 CFR \u00a7 200.311 \u201cReal property,\u201d and 2 CFR \u00a7 200.313 \u201cEquipment,\u201d or as specifically identified in federal statues, regulations, or the terms and conditions of its Award.\nf. Use of program income.  Unless FTA determines otherwise in writing, the Recipient may use program income earned during the period of performance of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement as follows: (1) The Recipient may retain the income for other capital or operating public transportation expenses. If the Recipient chooses not to use program income for current or future FTA Grants or Cooperative Agreements or for other public transportation purposes, then the amount of program income used for non-public transportation related purposes will be deducted from the total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs.\n(2) For each research-type project or related activities, the Recipient may add to the Award.\n(3) Depending on federal statutory or regulatory restrictions, the Recipient may use the program income for the non-federal share for a future public transportation Project that will receive federal assistance provided by FTA.\ng. Special Provisions for Program Income. FTA\u2019s programs have specific requirements for some types of program income and recipients should consult the applicable program circular for more detail about the use of program income under that specific program.\nFor example, for some FTA capital programs, revenues from the sale of advertising and concessions may be used as non-federal share and/or can be retained as part of a recipient\u2019s undisbursed cash surplus. For other programs, income from a service agreement with a State or local social service agency or a private social service organization to provide transportation may be used as the non-federal share for the Award in which the income is earned. In all other cases, program income may not be used to reduce the non-federal share of the Award from which it was earned, but may be used as non-federal share for future Awards.\nh. Income After the Performance Period of the Award. Except as otherwise determined in writing, the Recipient has no obligation to FTA regarding the disposition of program income earned after the end of the period of performance of the Award. FTA may negotiate agreements with recipients regarding appropriate uses of program income earned after the period of performance as part of the closeout process for the Award.\ni. Farebox Revenue. Farebox revenue may not be used as non-federal share for any of FTA\u2019s grant programs.  Farebox revenue is used to determine \u201cnet project cost\u201d for operating assistance grants only.  Farebox revenue is not considered program income for capital assistance grants. (See the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9030.1, \u201cUrbanized Area Formula Program: Program Guidance and Application Instructions,\u201d and the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9040.1 \u201cFormula Grants for Rural Areas: Program Guidance and Application Instructions.\n8. ANNUAL AUDIT.     a. General.  2 CFR part 200, subpart F Audit Requirements.  The OMB common rule, 2 CFR part 200 and the current OMB Compliance Supplement provide the requirements for annual audits of recipients, also known as the Single Audit.  Documentation regarding Single Audit requirements is available on the OMB Web site at: www.whitehouse.gov/omb/financial_fin_single_audit.\nb. Requirement.  In accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.501(a) and (b), recipients that expend $750,000 or more in a year in federal assistance from all sources must have a single audit conducted, except when they elect to have a program-specific audit conducted, 2 CFR \u00a7 200.501(c).  The audit must be completed and the data collection form and reporting package must be submitted within the earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor\u2019s report(s), or nine months of the end of the audit period.  If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, the reporting package is due the next business day.\nFTA recipients are required to obtain the services of an independent auditor to conduct a Single Audit each year in conformance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, except if a state constitution or statute provides for a single biennial audit or as permitted by 2 CFR \u00a7 200.504.\nRecipients are required to submit one copy of their annual single audit report to FTA if the audit report contains any findings and recommendations related to the FTA program or other DOT program findings.  In those cases in which the audit report does not contain any FTA findings or recommendations, a copy of only the Federal Clearinghouse transmittal sheet \u201cData Collection Form for Reporting on Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations, OMB Form SF-SAC\u201d should be submitted to the FTA regional or metropolitan office.\nRecipients must keep one copy of the data collection form and one copy of the audit reporting package on file for three years from the date of submission to the Federal Clearinghouse.  Pass-through entities must keep subrecipients\u2019 submissions on file for three years from date of receipt.\nc. Purpose.  The purpose of the single annual audit report is to determine whether the recipient:  (1) Has prepared financial statements that fairly present its financial position and the results of its financial position and the results of its financial operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\n(2) Has in place internal accounting and other control systems to provide reasonable assurance that it is managing its federal assistance programs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and\n(3) Has complied with laws and regulations that may have material effect on its financial statements and on each of its major federal assistance programs.\nThe annual Single Audit must be performed by an independent auditor who is required to determine and report on whether the recipient has internal control systems that reasonably assure that the recipient is managing federal assistance programs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nRecipients are required to determine whether certain subrecipients as described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.331 spend the federal assistance they receive in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  Audit judgment concerning the recipient\u2019s determination is left to the independent auditor.\nd. Resolution of Audit Findings.  Recipients and subrecipients are responsible for prompt resolution of all audit findings and recommendations.  This responsibility requires that the recipient:  (1) Promptly evaluate the report,\n(2) Determine the appropriate follow-up actions and establish a date for their completion, and\n(3) Complete all required actions within the established period of time.\nThe recipien", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "dcb6f946-934a-4b92-a616-99d4b2acc121"}, "7570882002906103321": {"text": "t must resolve the deficiencies or opportunities for improvement identified in their audit.  The resolution of audits begins with FTA\u2019s report to the recipient and continues until the recipient corrects identified deficiencies, implements needed improvements, or demonstrates that the findings or recommendations are not valid or do not warrant management action.\nThe audit cannot be closed until FTA concurs in the documentation of steps taken to implement any needed corrective actions.  The status of outstanding audit findings and recommendations should be monitored and reported by the recipient in quarterly progress reports and, where appropriate, significant events reported.\n9. PAYMENT PROCEDURES.       a. General.  Provisions in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.305 and 31 CFR part 205 govern payments to recipients for financing operations under federal assistance and other programs.  These regulations require that advance payment to a recipient be limited to the minimum amounts needed and timed to be in accord with only the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient in carrying out the purpose of the Award.  The timing and amount of advance payments must be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient for direct program or costs of the Award and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.  The recipient must make timely payment to third-party contractors in accordance with the third-party contract provisions.\nb. Verify the Availability of Federal Assistance.  Before a potential recipient requests federal assistance, they should verify in TrAMS that the amount of federal assistance to be accessed is available for the Award.  Federal assistance should not be requested in amounts greater than the \u201cAvailable Funds\u201d reported in TrAMS.\nc. Payment Methods.  FTA makes all payments by the Treasury\u2019s Automated Clearing House (ACH) method of payment, regardless of the dollar amount involved.  ACH electronically sends payment to a payee\u2019s account.  The payments to recipients are made using various methods of payments.   (1) Electronic Clearing House Operation (ECHO) Payment.  ECHO is a FTA Web-based application system that processes drawdown payment requests from FTA recipients.  Recipients can access ECHO via the Internet to submit their drawdown request.  ECHO then transmits requests approved for payment to the Recipients financial institution through Treasury\u2019s ACH process.  For further information, see FTA\u2019s \u201cFTA ECHO-Web User Manual\u201d at: https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grantee-resources/echo/echo-web-user-manual\n(2) Requisition Payment.  If the requisition payment method is used, the Standard Form 270 (SF-270), \u201cRequest for Advance or Reimbursement\u201d form is required to be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration, Enterprise Service Center (ESC) in Oklahoma City, via DELPHI e-Invoicing System or DELPHI Markview system.  Instructions for completing SF-270 and the ESC\u2019s mailing address can be found in Appendix H.  FTA recipients that receive federal assistance through cooperative agreements may not process payments through the ECHO system.\n(3) Reimbursement Procedures for Research, Technical Assistance, and Training Programs.  See the most recent edition of FTA Circular 6100, \u201cResearch, Technical Assistance and Training Program: Application Instructions and Program Management Guidelines.\u201d\nd. Policy for ECHO Payments.  FTA makes all payments by electronic funds transfer, regardless of the dollar amount involved.  Payments are made under the electronic clearing house operation Web (ECHO-Web) system, by means of an ECHO control number assigned to the recipient.  The recipient agrees to comply with the ECHO-Web requirements contained in the Treasury Regulations, 31 CFR part 205, \u201cRules and Procedures for Efficient Federal-State Funds Transfers,\u201d specifically 2 CFR \u00a7 200.305, \u201cPayments,\u201d and as established by the \u201cGuidelines for Disbursements\u201d set forth in FTA\u2019s ECHO-Web system operations manual.\nDisbursement guidelines are in accordance with policies established in Department of Treasury Circular 1075, part 205, \u201cWithdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under Federal Grant and Other Programs,\u201d and by its FTA Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  These guidelines state that the recipient must commit itself to:\n(1) Initiating cash drawdowns for immediate disbursement (no later than three business days for disbursement).  Excess federal assistance held more than three days must be returned to FTA along with any interest earned.  See Chapter VI, subsection 9.f, \u201cRepayment to FTA,\u201d below for detailed information on requirements to remit interest.\n(2) Reporting large disbursements to the appropriate FTA regional office in advance of the transaction settlement date.  The recipient must provide a minimum notice of two business days for a disbursement totaling $50 million or more, and a minimum notice of five days when a disbursement of more than $500 million is anticipated.  When specific information has not been finalized, the recipient must inform the FTA Regional Office of approximate amount(s) and approximate deposit date(s).  The FTA Headquarters Accounting Payable Division should be notified by the Regional Office due to the requirement that FTA must provide the Treasury 48 hour\u2019s notification prior to drawdown of federal assistance exceeding $50 million.\n(3) Reporting cash disbursements and balances in a timely manner as required by FTA.\n(4) Imposing the same standards of timing and amount upon any secondary recipients.\n(5) Limiting drawdowns to eligible costs to implement the Award, which would include NOT drawing down federal assistance for its Award in an amount that would exceed the sum obligated by FTA or the current available balance for that Award.\n(6) Providing control and accountability for all federal assistance consistent with FTA requirements and procedures for use of the ECHO System.\n(7) Furnishing reports of cash disbursements and balances, when required by means of the FFR.\n(8) Recipients cannot return funds (overpayments/credits) for projects from which they have not requested funds in three or more years.  ECHO-Web does not support return payments with accrued interest, isolated return payments, or return payments too large to be offset by a requested amount.  Recipients who are not able to use the ECHO-Web system shall follow the repayment procedures listed in section 9(g) below.\ne. Excessive or Premature Withdrawals.   (1) General.  For excess payments made by the Federal Government to a recipient that does not qualify as a \u201cclaim\u201d for purposes of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3701 et seq., the recipient agrees that the amount of interest owed to the Federal Government depends on whether the recipient is a state or state instrumentality.   (a) A recipient that is a state or state instrumentality agrees that interest owed to the Federal Government will be determined in accordance with Treasury regulations, \u201cRules and Procedures for Efficient Federal State Funds Transfers,\u201d 31 CFR part 205 that implements Section 5(b) of the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990, as amended, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 6503(b).\n(b) A recipient that is neither a state nor a state instrumentality agrees that common law interest owed to the Federal Government will be determined in accordance with joint Treasury/DOJ regulations, \u201cStandards for the Administrative Collection of Claims,\u201d at 31 CFR \u00a7 901.9(i).\n(2) Exceptions.  The only exceptions to the requirement for prompt refunding are when the federal assistance involved:  (a) Will be disbursed by the recipient within seven calendar days, or\n(b) Is less than $10,000 and will be disbursed within 30 calendar days.\nThese exceptions to the requirement for prompt refunding should not be construed as approval for a recipient to maintain excessive federal assistance.  They are applicable only to excessive amounts of federal assistance that are erroneously drawn.\n(3) Return of Federal Assistance.  The return of federal assistance is accomplished as follows:  (a) FTA requests the recipients to remit the excessive cash and any interest electronically to FTA using the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Pay.Gov Financial Collection System (www.Pay.gov).  Once you have gained accessed to the Web site: (1) click on \u201cMake a Payment;\u201d (2) scroll down to \u201cSearch by keyword\u201d and enter \u201cFTA;\u201d and (3) choose the appropriate form (FOIA Fee, Grantee Refunds/Over Payments, or Vendors/Employees).\n(b) The recipient must provide the requested information and submit.  Note: If making an ACH payment from your bank account, please select ACH Direct Debit as the payment type.\n(c) Although paper checks are discouraged, recipients may mail refund checks to FAA (FTA\u2019s Accounting Service Center) in Oklahoma City.  If a single check is used to remit the premature withdrawal and the interest, the amount of each must be separately identified and accompanied by a letter explaining the purpose of the check(s) and identifying the federal award identification number or project number.  A copy of the check and the letter should be sent to the recipient\u2019s Regional Office.  Additional information pertaining to the mailing of checks is located below in Chapter VI, subsection 9.g.\nf. Repayment to FTA.  FTA program managers will be alert to any information that may indicate a potential repayment.  The following are possible reasons for payments becoming due to FTA:  (1) Insufficient eligible funds to match federal payments,\n(2) The sale of equipment acquired or improved to implement the Award, or\n(3) Excessive federal assistance in the account for the Award.\ng. Repayment Procedure.  Required repayments must be made promptly to FTA.  Recipients can submit repayments through the Treasury\u2019s Pay.gov Financial Collection System (https://www.Pay.gov) for all refunds and repayments.  Refunds by check should be processed using the following steps:  (1) Make the check payable to", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "6e980114-e884-4707-a86b-9ce40d3a468d"}, "2940317973700046861": {"text": " the \u201cFederal Transit Administration.\u201d\n(2) Mail all checks to the FAA/Federal Transit Account as follows: (a) Regular Mail: DOT/FAA (FTA Account), ESC, AMZ-300, PO Box 269041, Oklahoma City, OK 73125, or\n(b) Overnight Mail: DOT/FAA (FTA Account), ESC, AMZ-300, 6500 S.  Macarthur Blvd, HQS Bldg. RM 181, Oklahoma City, OK 73169, Attn: Rhonda Manuel (405-954-8195).\n(3) Specify the applicable federal award identification number(s) or project number(s) on the check.\n(4) Provide a written explanation as to purpose of payment.\n(5) Send a copy of the check and the explanatory letter to the recipient\u2019s regional or metropolitan office.\n(6) While ECHO-Web is primarily designed as a payment request system, the system can accommodate return payments recipients may need to make on a project if a return meets processing parameters.  The Department of Treasury does not withdraw funds from an organization\u2019s bank account, so any amounts returned via ECHO-Web must be netted against requested funds.  This means the recipient can make a return payment only if also making a new payment request on the same form, and the Total Requested Amount (which calculates the Request minus the Return) is a positive number.  Recipients who are not able to use the ECHO-Web system shall follow the repayment procedures listed above.\nh. Requirement to Remit Interest.  FTA\u2019s Master Agreement states that recipients must remit any interest earned on excess federal assistance the recipient has drawn down and failed to spend for eligible activities under the Award, or any federal interest held in excess of three calendar days.  Payments of interest must be made by using the Pay.gov Financial Collection System.\nUnless waived by FTA, interest will be calculated at rates imposed by the Department of the Treasury (www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) beginning on the fourth day after the federal assistance was deposited in the recipient\u2019s bank or other financial depository.  Upon notice by FTA to the recipient of specific amounts due, the recipient must promptly remit to FTA any excess federal assistance payments, including any interest due.\n10. DEOBLIGATION OF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE.  FTA reserves the right to deobligate unspent federal assistance before closeout of the Award.\n11. DEBT SERVICE RESERVE.  Transit agencies that use debt financing in the form of bonds are often required by the terms of the Bond Indenture to establish a Debt Service Reserve (DSR).  The Bond Trustee is required to establish a DSR with the proceeds of the bond issue.  Usually, the DSR remains untouched for the term of the bonds, and is used to make a subsequent debt service payment ONLY if the recipient has insufficient funds to do so.  If the DSR is used in this way, the recipient must replenish the DSR from its own funds and within the time frames outlined in the Bond Indenture or be in default.  When there is no default, the balances remaining in the DSR are used to make the last debt service payment to the extent of such balances.  Required DSRs may now be financed with FTA assistance.  However, to the extent of FTA assistance, any particular DSR may only be used to pay principal and/or interest on the bonds.  Therefore, recipients intending to fund a DSR with FTA assistance may also wish to include some non-FTA funds if the terms of the Bond Indenture allow use of DSR for other items, such as late fees or Bond Trustee expenses related to default.\n12. RIGHT OF FTA TO TERMINATE.  The recipient agrees that, upon written notice, FTA may suspend or terminate all or part of the federal assistance provided herein if the recipient is, or has been, in violation of the terms of the Award, or if FTA determines that the purposes of the statute under which the Award is authorized would not be adequately served by continuation of federal assistance for the Award.  Any failure to make reasonable progress or other violation of the Award that significantly endangers substantial performance of the Award will be deemed to be a breach of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement accompanying the Award.\nIn general, termination of any federal assistance for the Award will not invalidate obligations properly incurred by the recipient and concurred in by FTA before the termination date, to the extent those obligations cannot be canceled.  However, if FTA determines that the recipient misused FTA assistance by failing to make adequate progress, to make reasonable use of the real property, facilities, or equipment acquired or improved for the Award, or to honor the terms of the Award, FTA reserves the right to require the recipient to refund the entire amount of federal assistance provided herein or any lesser amount as may be determined by FTA.\nExpiration of any time period established for the Award, does not, by itself constitute an expiration or termination of the Award.\nNeither the receipt by the recipient of any federal assistance for the Award nor the closeout of federal participation in the Award shall constitute a waiver of any claim that FTA may otherwise have arising out of the Award.\n", "doc_id": null,

Transportation\nFederal Transit\nAdministration\nFTA C 5010.1E\n\nMarch 21, 2017\nRev. 1, July 21, 2017\nRev. 2, July 16, 2018\nSubject: AWARD MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS\n1. PURPOSE.  This circular is a reissuance of guidance (previously \u201cGrant Management Requirements\u201d) for post-award administration and management activities for all applicable Federal Transit Administration (FTA) federal assistance programs.  This revision incorporates provisions of the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) programs and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) programs.  This circular includes the most current guidance for the federal public transportation programs as of the date of publication.\nThis circular revision also incorporates provisions of U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d 2 CFR part 1201.  These regulations incorporate by reference the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d 2 CFR part 200, which supersedes and streamlines the former OMB Circulars on Uniform Administrative Guidance, A-102 and A-110, former OMB Circulars on Cost Principles,      A-21, A-87, and A-122, and former OMB Circulars addressing Single Audit issues, A-133 on Single Audit Act administration and A-50 on Single Audit Act follow-up.  OMB\u2019s final guidance consolidates the guidance previously contained in the aforementioned documents into a streamlined format that aims to improve both clarity and accessibility. The U.S. DOT adopts this guidance, with a few DOT-specific provisions.\nThe U.S. DOT regulations, 2 CFR part 1201, supersede and repeal the requirements of the former U.S. DOT Common Rules, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments,\u201d former 49 CFR part 18, and \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and other Non- Profit Organizations,\u201d former 49 CFR part 19.\nGrant Agreements and Cooperative Agreements awarded before December 26, 2014, however, shall continue to be subject to the former U.S. DOT Common Rules, 49 CFR parts 18 and 19, and OMB guidance in effect on the date FTA awarded federal assistance for such Grant or Cooperative Agreements.\nThese requirements are intended to assist recipients in administering FTA-funded projects and in meeting the responsibilities and reporting requirements of FTA Awards.  Recipients have a responsibility to comply with regulatory requirements and to be aware of all pertinent materials to assist in the management of their federally assisted Awards.\n2. CANCELLATION. This circular cancels FTA Circular 5010.1D, \u201cGrant Management Guidelines,\u201d dated 08-27-2012.\n3. AUTHORITY.  a. Federal Transit Laws, codified at 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.\nb. 49 CFR \u00a7 1.91.\n4. WAIVER. FTA reserves the right to waive any provision of this circular to the extent permitted by federal law or regulation.\n5. FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICE. In conjunction with publication of this circular, a Federal Register notice was published on January 13, 2017.\n6. AMENDMENTS TO THE CIRCULAR. FTA reserves the right to update this circular to reflect changes in other revised or new guidance and regulations that undergo notice and comment without further notice and comment on this circular.

GENERAL.  The Scope of Work is a written set of expectations that form an agreement or understanding between the appraiser and the recipient as to the specific requirements of the appraisal, resulting in a report to be delivered to the recipient by the appraiser.  It includes identification of the intended use and intended user; definition of market value; statement of assumptions and limiting conditions; and certifications.  This agreement should specify the performance requirements, or it should reference them from another source, such as the recipient\u2019s approved Right-of-Way or Appraisal Manual.  The Scope of Work must address the unique, unusual, and variable appraisal performance requirements of the appraisal.  Either the appraiser or the recipient may recommend modifications to the initial Scope of Work, but both parties must approve changes.\n2. EXAMPLE.  The example below is intended to be a guide for recipients preparing a Scope of Work for real estate appraisals.   a. Scope of Work: The appraiser must, at a minimum:  (1) Provide an appraisal meeting the recipient\u2019s definition of an appraisal, or, at a minimum, the definition of an appraisal must be compatible with the definition found at 49 CFR \u00a7 24.2(a)(3).\n(2) Afford the property owner or the owner\u2019s designated representative the opportunity to accompany the appraiser on the inspection of the property.\n(3) Perform an inspection of the subject property.  The inspection should be appropriate for the appraisal problem, and the Scope of Work should address:  a) The extent of the inspection and description of the neighborhood and proposed project area,\nb) The extent of the subject property inspection, including interior and exterior areas, and\nc) The level of detail of the description of the physical characteristics of the property being appraised (and, in the case of a partial acquisition, the remaining property).\n(4) In the appraisal report, include a sketch of the property and provide the location and dimensions of any improvements.  Also, the report should include adequate photographs of the subject property and comparable sales and provide location maps of the property and comparable sales.\n(5) In the appraisal report, include items required by the acquiring recipient, usually consisting of the following:  a) The property right(s) to be acquired, e.g., fee simple, easement, etc.,\nb) The value being appraised (usually fair market value), and its definition,\nc) The appraisal of contaminated property that would get at the difference in value, were the property clean,\nd) The date of the appraisal report and the date of valuation,\ne) The realty/personalty report required at 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103(a)(3)(i)\u2013(v),\nf) The known and observed encumbrances, if any,\ng) The title information,\nh) The location,\ni) The zoning requirements and restrictions,\nj) The property\u2019s present use, and\nk) At least a 5-year sales history of the property.\n(6) In the appraisal report, identify the highest and best use.  If the highest and best use is in question or different from the existing use, provide an appropriate analysis identifying the market-based highest and best use.\n(7) Present and analyze relevant market information.  Specific requirements should include research, analysis, and verification of comparable sales.  Inspection of the comparable sales should also be specified.\n(8) In developing and reporting the appraisal, disregard any decrease or increase in the fair market value of the real property caused by the project for which the property is to be acquired or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for the project.  If necessary, the appraiser may cite the Jurisdictional Exception or Supplemental Standards Rules under Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) to ensure compliance with USPAP while following this Uniform Act requirement.\n(9) The appraiser\u2019s analysis, opinions, and conclusions must be included in the appraisal report.\nb. Additional Requirements for a Scope of Work: (1) Intended Use: This appraisal is to estimate the fair market value of the property, as of the specified date of valuation, for the proposed acquisition of the property rights specified (i.e., fee simple, etc.) for a federally assisted project.\n(2) Intended User: The intended user of this appraisal report is primarily the acquiring agency (ultimately the recipient), but its funding partners may review the appraisal as part of their program oversight activities.\n(3) Definition of Market Value: This is determined by state law, but includes the following:  a) The buyer and seller are typically motivated;\nb) Both parties are well informed or well advised, each acting in what he or she considers his or her own best interest;\nc) A reasonable time is al", "doc_id": "8a2fd707-c7f7-4803-8eea-01c519a43976", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "6020aa3b-6fce-4d0a-86c2-130d2d41a402": {"text": "lowed for exposure in the open market;\nd) Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and\ne) The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.\n(4) Certification: The required certification should be in the State\u2019s approved Appraisal Procedures or part of state law.\n(5) Assumptions and Limiting Conditions: The appraiser shall state all relevant assumptions and limiting conditions.  In addition, the acquiring agency may provide other assumptions and conditions that may be required for the particular appraisal assignment, such as:  a) The data search requirements and parameters that may be required for the project,\nb) Identification of the technology requirements, including approaches to value, to be used to analyze the data,\nc) Need for machinery and equipment appraisals, soil studies, potential zoning changes, etc.,\nd) Instructions to the appraiser to appraise the property \u201cAs Is\u201d or subject to repairs or corrective action, and\ne) As applicable include any information on property contamination to be provided and considered by the appraiser in making the appraisal.\n3. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.  One of the persistently difficult issues is the valuation of property with potential and/or known hazardous materials or contamination.  Therefore, it is important that the environmental conditions of all parcels considered for acquisition be assessed according to ASTM standards.  The following guidance will assist recipients in developing a Scope of Work for assessing the environmental conditions of parcels and for appraising those that are found to be contaminated or have hazardous materials present.\nRecipients must investigate the environmental conditions of all parcels proposed for purchase in order to identify potential contamination on the property.  This site investigation work includes conducting a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) (in accordance with ASTM standards) for all parcels.  If the Phase I ESA identifies potential contamination or recognized environmental concerns, a Phase II ESA should be conducted to confirm the presence and extent of any contamination.  The ESAs should have been completed as a part of the overall environmental review process undertaken during an early phase of the project.  If not, the recipient should conduct ESAs for all parcels prior to the appraisal.\nThe presence of contamination is regarded as a detriment to the property and should be handled like other negative characteristics or limitations of a property relative to the determination of its highest and best use (HBU) or greatest market value.  From an appraisal perspective, dealing with contamination is much like addressing other conditions affecting the use and value of the property.  It is FTA policy that the effect of contamination on the value of a property should be considered in the appraisal to the extent feasible.  If the contaminant is a detriment for the property, the reduction in value of the property attributable to that detriment should be considered by the real estate appraiser.\nAppraisers are not expected to be experts in the field of property contamination.  Therefore, the results of the previously mentioned ESAs must be provided to the appraiser before the appraisal work is initiated, whenever feasible.  The recipient or its environmental consultant should be available to answer any questions that an appraiser may have regarding the environmental testing report(s) that pertains to the HBU and the value of the property.  The appraiser is expected to be competent in the analysis of the impact of contamination on the value of the parcel being appraised.\nThe environmental reports, estimated remediation costs and specifications for the required remediation, along with any specific direction from the recipient regarding the applicability of state law or agency procedures related to the valuation of contaminated property, must be provided to the appraiser.  The existence of detrimental contamination must also be defined by the recipient in analyzing the approach to the appraisal problem.  The approach will necessarily involve an understanding of the purpose and use of the property within the context of the construction design plans of the project, specifically in terms of excavation that may be required for the intended use or use only as surface parking, as examples.  These issues as they pertain to the subject site should be included as an element of the appraisal Scope of Work that is mutually agreed to by the recipient and the appraiser.  Recipients must not offer a conclusion of the impact of the contamination, but should insist that the appraiser\nevaluate the value impact of its presence using the expert site reports and project construction plans.\nThe following guidance is offered to assist a recipient valuing a contaminated site.  It is general and broad.  FTA should be contacted for further specific direction.\na. For commercial/industrial properties: (1) Situation: The property contains contaminants or hazardous materials that must be mitigated before any use of the property is practical.  Approach: In cases such as this, generally, the cost to mitigate the contaminated materials to permit the HBU should be deducted from the potential estimated value to achieve that highest and best use.\n(2) Situation: The property is contaminated, but can be used at its highest and best use without remediation.  Approach: In this situation, the appraiser would value the property at its highest and best use and only make an adjustment if the market indicates such an adjustment is necessary.  Other similarly contaminated property would be a good indication of value and any further adjustment may not be required.\n(3) Situation: An improved property has building components that contain hazardous materials (asbestos, lead paint, etc.) and the market considers these items to be a detriment to value.  Approach: In this situation, the appraiser should consider the appropriate cost to cure such deficiencies, based on market dynamics.\n(4) Situation: The property formerly was contaminated but is now remediated.  Approach: In this situation, the appraiser should consider any residual \u201cstigma\u201d that might be caused by possible future requirements or the market resistance to such remediated properties when similar clean substitute properties are available.  Comparable sales of similarly remediated property would be the best indication of value.\nb. For residential properties: (1) Situation: The building contains hazardous material, but the market apparently does not adjust for such items (e.g., asbestos shingles, asbestos floor tile).  Approach: In this situation, the appraiser should note the items and note that the market does not make an adjustment for them.  Valuation would be unaffected by the presence of the contaminant in such a case.  If remediation is only necessary because of the development of the transit project, that remediation would be an eligible expense under the Award given that the expense cannot be recouped from the seller and would be needed for the project.\n(2) The building contains hazardous materials and the market typically requires remediation or adjustment (friable exposed asbestos, chipping lead paint).  Approach: In this situation, the estimated cost to cure the detriment to value should be considered and deducted from the value as clean, unless this cost to cure is greater than the present value of the structure.\nRegardless of the type of property, it is important that the effect on value of the contamination or hazardous material be measured by the impact on the value of the property assuming a typical market transaction based on HBU analysis and the degree of non-contamination dictated by the project construction specifications regarding construction activity on that parcel property.\nAPPENDIX E:   ROLLING STOCK STATUS REPORT\n1. GENERAL.  When an agency is disposing of vehicles that have met their minimum useful life that have a fair market value greater than $5,000, or is disposing of vehicles before they reach their minimum useful life, or is requesting a revision to the Award affecting those vehicles, the Rolling Stock Status Report (See example on next page) should include the following information:  a. Vehicle Number\nb. Year\nc. Make/Model\nd. Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)\ne. Date Placed in Revenue Service\nf. Date Removed from Revenue Service\ng. Minimum Useful Life (Years and Miles)\nh. Mileage (At the time Removed from Revenue Service)\ni. Total Number of Vehicles\nj. Total Number of Peak Vehicle Requirements\nk. Total Number of Spare Vehicles\n2. REPLACEMENTS AT THE END OF THE MINIMUM USEFUL LIFE.  Rolling Stock Status Reports must accompany a request for a replacement vehicle that has met its minimum useful life.  The report will be used to verify that a vehicle has met the minimum useful life and that there is no remaining federal interest.  Note: Though the remaining federal interest might be zero, if the asset\u2019s value exceeds $5,000, FTA may still be entitled to reimbursement.  See Chapter IV, subsection 4.o, \u201cDisposition of Equipment and Supplies,\u201d for more information about project property valued over $5,000.\n3. EARLY DISPOSITION.  Rolling Stock Status Reports must accompany a request for early disposition of vehicles.  The report will be used to verify the remaining federal interest in the vehicles.\n4. EXAMPLE.  An example of a Rolling Stock Status Report for vehicles pending disposal with and without remaining federal interest or budget revision affecting vehicles is shown on the following page.\nExample: Rolling Stock Status Report\nTransAmerica Buses\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nVeh #\nVehicle Year\nMake/Model or Vehicle Description\nDate in Service\nOut of Service\nFed Useful Life (yr)\nActual Service ", "doc_id": "6020aa3b-6fce-4d0a-86c2-130d2d41a402", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "9a3dd928-4553-4c50-a30c-e400bbfedca0": {"text": "(yr)\nRemaining yrs\nRemaining % based on yrs\nActual Mileage\nMinimum Useful Life Mileage\nRemaining % based on miles\nTotal Federal Share\nRemaining Fed Share based on yrs\nRemaining Fed Share based on miles\n151\n2000\n30' New Flyers\n9/1/00\n9/1/07\n7\n7\n0\n-0.04%\n200,000\n200,000\n0.00%\n$120,000\n-\n-\n152\n2000\n30' New Flyers\n9/1/00\n9/3/07\n7\n7\n-0.01\n-0.12%\n200,000\n200,000\n0.00%\n$120,000\n-\n-\n154\n2000\n30' New Flyers\n9/1/00\n9/2/07\n7\n7\n-0.01\n-0.08%\n210,000\n200,000\n-5.00%\n$120,000\n-\n-\n155\n2000\n30' New Flyers\n9/1/00\n9/2/07\n7\n7\n-0.01\n-0.08%\n205,000\n200,000\n-2.50%\n$120,000\n-\n-\n156\n2000\n30' New Flyers\n3/1/01\n3/1/06\n7\n5\n2\n28.53%\n140,851\n200,000\n29.57%\n$120,000\n$34,239\n$35,489\n157\n2000\n30' New Flyers\n3/1/01\n3/1/06\n7\n5\n2\n28.53%\n154,649\n200,000\n22.68%\n$120,000\n$34,239\n$27,211\n158\n2000\n35' Flexible\n3/1/01\n6/3/06\n10\n5.3\n4.74\n47.40%\n200,000\n350,000\n42.86%\n$120,000\n$56,877\n$51,429\n159\n2001\n35' Flexible\n3/1/01\n6/3/06\n10\n5.3\n4.74\n47.40%\n300,000\n350,000\n14.29%\n$195,000\n$92,425\n$27,857\n160\n2001\n35' Flexible\n3/1/01\n11/2/07\n10\n6.7\n3.32\n33.23%\n300,000\n350,000\n14.29%\n$195,000\n$64,804\n$27,857\n161\n2001\n35' Flexible\n3/1/01\n7/2/07\n10\n6.3\n3.66\n36.60%\n325,000\n350,000\n7.14%\n$195,000\n$71,375\n$13,929\n163\n2001\n35' Flexible\n3/1/01\n11/2/07\n10\n6.7\n3.32\n33.23%\n325,000\n350,000\n7.14%\n$195,000\n$64,804\n$13,929\n164\n1996\n40' Buses\n3/21/96\n4/3/06\n12\n10\n1.96\n16.32%\n425,000\n500,000\n15.00%\n$295,000\n$48,156\n$44,250\n165\n1996\n40' Buses\n6/19/96\n4/3/07\n12\n10.8\n1.21\n10.05%\n435,000\n500,000\n13.00%\n$295,000\n$29,635\n$38,350\n166\n1996\n40' Buses\n6/19/96\n4/3/07\n12\n10.8\n1.21\n10.05%\n450,000\n500,000\n10.00%\n$295,000\n$29,635\n$29,500\n167\n1996\n40' Buses\n6/20/96\n6/2/07\n12\n11\n1.04\n8.70%\n450,000\n500,000\n10.00%\n$295,000\n$25,661\n$29,500\n168\n1996\n40' Buses\n6/23/96\n6/2/07\n12\n10.9\n1.05\n8.77%\n450,000\n500,000\n10.00%\n$295,000\n$25,863\n$29,500\nAPPENDIX F:   COST ALLOCATION PLANS\n1. GENERAL.  As authorized by 2 CFR \u00a7 200.27, FTA uses the term \u201ccost allocation plan\u201d (CAP) to mean central service cost allocation plan.  Central service cost allocation plan means the documentation identifying, accumulating, and allocating or developing billing rates based on the allowable costs of services provided by a state or local government, or Indian tribe, on a centralized basis to its departments and agencies, per 2 CFR \u00a7 200.9.  Most state and local governments, and Indian tribes provide certain services, such as motor pools, computer centers, purchasing, accounting, etc., to operating agencies on a centralized basis.  A central service cost allocation plan provides the process by which these central service costs can be identified and assigned to benefited activities on a reasonable and consistent basis.  All costs and other data used to distribute the costs included in the plan should be supported by formal accounting and other records that will support the propriety of the costs assigned to federal Award.\nThe central service cost allocation plan will include all central service costs that will be claimed (either as a billed or an allocated cost) under federal Award and will be documented as described in 2 CFR part 200, Appendix V, section E, \u201cDocumentation Requirements for Submitted Plans.\u201d1  Costs of central services omitted from the plan will not be reimbursed.  Following are the general requirements for CAPs:\n1 While centralized services cost allocation plans are not required for institutions of higher education (IHE) or nonprofit entities, 2 CFR part 200, Appendices III and IV, respectively, do require IHEs and nonprofit entities to allocate costs.\na. CAPs must be updated annually and made available for review at the state\u2019s or local government\u2019s single audit.\nb. CAPs must be approved in accordance with the requirements of the federal cognizant agency for indirect costs.\nc. Additionally, all costs in the plan must be supported by formal accounting records to substantiate the propriety of eventual charges.  Central service costs that are not included in the plan should not be reimbursed by federal Awards.  To the extent feasible, CAPS should be presented in a single document.\n2. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS.  All proposed central service allocation plans must be accompanied by the following:  a. An organization chart sufficiently detailed to show operations including the central service activities of the state, local government or Indian tribe, whether or not they are shown as benefitting from central service functions;\nb. A copy of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (or a copy of the Executive Budget if budgeted costs are being proposed) to support the allowable costs of each central service activity included in the plan;\nc. A certification of conformance which states that the plan was prepared in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, Appendix V, subsection E.4 and the federal Award(s) to which they apply.\nd. Unallowable costs have been adjusted as indicated in the cost allocation plan.\ne. The same costs that have been treated as indirect costs have not been claimed as direct costs.\nf. Federal Awards contain only allowable costs, and the plan was prepared in a manner that treated similar costs consistently among the various federal Awards and between federal and non-federal awards/activities.\ng. A proposal to establish a CAP will be unacceptable if the CAP Certificate is omitted.  The certificate must be signed on behalf of the governmental unit by an individual at a level no lower than chief financial officer of the governmental unit that submits the plan.  For details related to documentation requirements for allocated and billed central service costs refer to 2 CFR part 200, Appendix V, section E, \u201cDocumentation Requirements for Submitted Plans,\u201d numbers 2, 3, and 4, respectively.\n3. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.  The Cost Allocation Plan must be submitted to the recipient\u2019s Federal Cognizant Agency for indirect costs for approval based on the following:   a. Each state will submit its CAP to the Department of Health and Human Services each year.\nb. Each major local government (one which receives more than $100 million in direct federal Awards) is required to submit the CAP to its cognizant agency for indirect costs annually.\nc. All other local governments must prepare and retain CAPs for the Single Audit and submit CAPs only when required by the cognizant agency.\nd. When FTA is the cognizant agency, the CAP must be submitted under the following circumstances: (1) for an initial plan, (2) annually for major local governments, (3) for a change in organizational structure and accounting system that may significantly impact the CAP, (4) for a change in CAP methodology, and/or (5) upon request for all other entities.  All CAPs must be retained for audit.\nWhenever the cognizant agency gives approval to a government-wide CAP, such approval should be formalized, in a written agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the state, local government, or Indian tribe, and distributed to all interested federal agencies, and applicable to all federal Awards in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, Appendix V.  See information below.  (See 2 CFR part 200, Appendix VII for more detailed information on States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals.)\n2 CFR part 200, Appendix V, section D.  \u201cSubmission Requirements\u201d states:\n(1) Each state will submit a plan to the Department of Health and Human Services for each year in which it claims central service costs under federal Awards.  The plan should include (a) a projection of the next year\u2019s allocated central service cost (based either on actual costs for the most recently completed year or the budget projection for the coming year), and (b) a reconciliation of actual allocated central service costs to the estimated costs used for either the most recently completed year or the year immediately preceding the most recently completed year.\n(2) Each major local government is also required to submit a plan to its cognizant agency for indirect costs annually.\n(3) All other local governments claiming central service costs must develop a plan in accordance with the requirements described in this Part and maintain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit.  These local governments are not required to submit their plans for federal approval unless they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.  Where a local government only receives funds as a subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be responsible for monitoring the subrecipient\u2019s plan.\n(4) All central service cost allocation plans will be prepared by governmental units or agencies that receive over $35 million per year in direct Federal funding and, when required, submitted within six months after the close of each of the governmental unit\u2019s fiscal years in which it proposes to claim central service costs.  Extensions may be granted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs on a case-by-case basis.\n4. FTA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  Generally central service costs are included in the indirect cost pool(s) of the operating governmental departments or agencies.  Therefore, central service costs are generally included in the overall indirect cost information that is required in the FFR.\n5. FTA REVIEWS OF CAPS.  CAPs submitted to the FTA for approval are subject to review.  The purpose of a CAP proposal review is to ensure that the methodology and the rates proposed by the recipient meet the criteria contained in 2 CFR part 200 and FTA policies as a condition for reimbursement.\n6.

Indirect cost rate proposal means the documentation prepared by a recipient or subrecipient to substantiate its request for the establishment of an indirect cost rate.  Individual operating agencies (governmental department or agency) and non-profit recipients, normally charge federal Awards for indirect costs through an indirect cost rate.  A separate indirect cost rate(s) proposal for each operating agency is usually necessary to claim indirect costs under federal Awards.  Indirect costs include: (1) the indirect costs originating in each department or agency of the recipient carrying out federal Awards; and (2) the costs of central governmental services distributed through the central service cost allocation plan and not otherwise treated as direct costs (See Appendix F, Cost Allocation Plans).\nRecipients that intend to seek the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) reimbursement for indirect costs must prepare an Indirect Cost Rate Proposal (ICRP) unless the Recipient has never negotiated an indirect cost rate and chooses to use a de minimis rate of 10% of the modified total direct cost.  Also, recipients that already have an established indirect cost rate may apply for a 4-year extension of their current negotiated indirect cost rate for a maximum period of up to five years.  Note that only final or predetermined rates may be extended.  Any recipient who receives more than $35 million in direct federal funding must submit its indirect cost rate proposal to its cognizant agency for indirect costs.\nFor those recipients that do not choose to use the de minimis rate or receive approval of an extension of their current negotiated indirect cost rate, the following are basic requirements for an ICRP.\na. ICRPs must be updated annually.\nb. The updated ICRP must be retained and made available for review at the recipient\u2019s annual single audit.\nc. The initial ICRP must be approved by FTA or another cognizant federal agency.  The cognizant agency is the agency responsible for reviewing and approving the recipient\u2019s ICRP.  For subsequent approvals, please refer to section 3 of this appendix.\nAdditionally, all costs in the ICRP must be supported by formal accounting records to substantiate the propriety of eventual charges.  The ICRP of the recipient should cover all applicable costs.  It should also cover costs allocated under plans of other agencies or organizational units which are to be included in the costs of other federally sponsored programs.  To the extent feasible, ICRPs of all agencies rendering assistance to the recipient should be presented in a single document.\n2. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS.  Documentation requirements for an ICRP vary based on the type of organization.  See section 7 below for references to the requirements for\neach type of organization.  In general, the ICRP should contain, but need not be limited to, the following:  a. An Organization Chart.\nb. Financial Statements.\nc. ICRP Methodology \u2013 under 2 CFR part 200, Appendix VII - the recipient may use a simplified method or multiple allocation base method for completing the indirect cost rate proposal.  Generally, the simplified method is used where a recipient\u2019s major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately the same degree.  The simplified method results in one indirect cost rate for the entire recipient.  Conversely the multiple allocation base method is used where a recipient\u2019s major functions benefit from indirect costs to varying degrees.  The multiple allocation base method results in two or more rates related to each operating department or similar operating departments within the recipient.  The calculations of the rates depend on the type of organization, therefore refer to 2 CFR part 200 for details.\nd. Supporting Documentation:  (1) Identification of the costs included in the indirect cost pool(s),\n(2) Identification and description of the allocation base(s),\n(3) Identification of the amount, nature, and treatment of unallowable costs and excluded items,\n(4) Descriptions of the departments included in the organizational chart, including the nature of costs (direct, indirect, or combination),\n(5) Please refer to the appropriate appendix of 2 CFR part 200 for additional documentation requirements (See 8 below),\n(6) Proposal Reconciliation with Financial Statements (Note: Allocated costs must be reasonable and trackable to the financial Statements),\n(7) Identification of Federal Award Direct Cost Base (Note: Bases should be reasonable and trackable to the financial statements and supporting documents); and\n(8) Certification of Conformance with 2 CFR part 200.  A proposal to establish an Indirect Cost Rate Proposal will be unacceptable if the Certificate of Indirect Costs is omitted.  The certificate must be signed on behalf of the governmental unit by an individual at a level no lower than chief financial officer of the governmental unit that submits the proposal or component covered by the proposal.\n3. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.  2 CFR part 200, Appendix VII, section D, \u201cSubmission and Documentation of Proposals,\u201d - requires that each local governmental unit or agency that\nreceives more than $35 million in direct federal funding is required to submit a proposal to its cognizant agency for indirect costs within six months prior to the beginning of the recipient\u2019s fiscal year.  All other governmental units claiming indirect costs must develop a plan and maintain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit.  These local governments are not required to submit their plans for federal approval unless they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.\nNon-profit organizations are required to submit their ICRP to the cognizant agency within six months after the close of each fiscal year.\nInstitutions of higher education (IHE) should submit their indirect costs rate proposals to their cognizant agency (generally HHS or DoD).  The deadlines for submission of IHE ICRPs are determined by the cognizant agency.\nWhen a subrecipient only receives federal funds as a subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be responsible for reviewing, approving, negotiating, and monitoring the subrecipient\u2019s ICRP.\nWhen FTA is the cognizant agency for indirect costs, the ICRP should be submitted to the FTA when:\na. The recipient is working on its first federal assistance Award or has not previously had an Indirect Cost Rate Proposal reviewed and accepted (note that such recipients may be eligible for the de minimis rate described in section 1 above).\nb. The recipient has made a change in its accounting system that significantly impacts the previously approved Indirect Cost Rate Proposal and its basis of application.\nc. The recipient\u2019s proposed Indirect Cost Rate Proposal exceeds the rate(s) last approved by FTA by more than 20 percent.\nFor example, if FTA approved a 20 percent rate in 2013, and the rate increased to 23 percent in 2014, and again to 25 percent in 2015, the 2015 rate would be required to be submitted to FTA for approval as it increased by more than 20 percent.\nd. The recipient changes the Indirect Cost Rate Proposal methodology.\ne. The recipient is either a local governmental unit that receives more than $35 million in direct federal funding or a non-profit entity.  In accordance with 2 CFR part 200, these entities must submit their plan annually to their cognizant agency.\nThe FTA may allow the recipient to use a provisional rate for initial submissions and required resubmissions pending completion of the review/negotiation.  After the rate is approved, that rate and subsequent rates should be applied as fixed rates until a resubmission is required.  Fixed rate means an indirect cost rate that is applicable to a specified current or future period, usually the governmental unit\u2019s fiscal year.  This rate is based on an estimate of the costs to be incurred during the period and the difference between the estimated costs\nand the actual allowable costs of the period covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent period.\nUnder unique circumstances, on a case by case basis, the FTA will approve a predetermined rate.  For definitions of provisional rates, final rates, fixed rates, and predetermined rates please refer to 2 CFR part 200, Appendix VII, section B, \u201cDefinitions\u201d.\n4. FTA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  Award Budgets should clearly identify proposed indirect costs that are budgeted separately or are part of an activity line item (ALI).  Either documentation of the approved indirect cost rate or a statement that the recipient\u2019s rate needs to be approved by its cognizant agency should be submitted with an application for federal assistance.\nAfter the Award, recipients that have approved indirect cost rate proposals should include indirect cost information in the Federal Financial Report (FFR).  Indirect costs should be included in total expenditures.  Also, the FFR should include the indirect expense type, the rate approved by the cognizant agency, the total base amount on which the indirect cost rate is determined, the period covered by the approved rate, the total amount of indirect expenses charged to the Award on a cumulative basis, and the federal share of the indirect expenses charged.  Recipients that do not have approved indirect cost rate proposals should not charge indirect costs to FTA Awards.  See FFR instructions for entering data for single simplified rates or multiple rates.\n5. FTA REVIEWS OF INDIRECT COST RATE PROPOSALS.  ICRPs submitted to the FTA for approval are subject to review.  The purpose of an indirect cost rate proposal review is to ensure that the methodology and the rates proposed by the recipient meet the criteria contained in 2 CFR part 200 and FTA ", "doc_id": "7ac3f2b8-94ef-4a6c-aca6-dafc99c1e14f", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "f9529d48-c1ad-411a-b968-8f5f1742bb05": {"text": "policies as a condition for reimbursement.\n6. ICRP APPROVAL.  Whenever the cognizant agency gives approval to an Indirect Cost Rate Proposal, such approval is formalized, distributed to all interested federal agencies, and applicable to all federal Awards in accordance with 2 CFR part 200.\n7.

All official Frequently Asked Questions and updates to 2 CFR part 200.\nAPPENDIX H:   REQUEST FOR ADVANCE OR REIMBURSEMENT (SF\u2013270)\n1. GENERAL.  Recipients that receive federal assistance through cooperative agreements, and any recipients that receive funds through Grant or Cooperative Agreements (or Other Agreements) that are not permitted to receive payment or reimbursement via ECHO, agree as follows:  a. New recipients must first provide financial information to enroll in the automated clearinghouse (ACH) system.  Assistance will be provided by the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA\u2019s) Enterprise Service Center (ESC) and the administering office.\nb. Recipient must complete and attach an original Standard Form 270, \u201cRequest for Advance or Reimbursement\u201d (See Sample Request for Advance or Reimbursement Form [SF\u2013270] Exhibit 2 of this appendix) with supporting documentation when submitting request for reimbursement via DELPHI e-Invoicing System or DELPHI Markview system.  Upon receipt of the SF-270 payment request and supporting documentation, ESC will disburse payments by ACH deposit for all requests approved by the authorized FTA Project Manager in the DELPHI e-Invoicing System or DELPHI Markview system.\nc. Recipients may also complete and submit an original SF-270 to ESC at:\nFAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center  Library, AMA\u2013300A 6500 S.  MacArthur Blvd. Oklahoma City, OK 73169\nHowever, the preferred method of submission is electronically through the DELPHI e-Invoicing systems listed above.\n2. INSTRUCTIONS.  Instructions for completing an SF-270 (Exhibit 2) are printed on its reverse side.  In addition, the following instructions should assist recipients in completing this form:  a. Only the total column on this form should be completed, unless the project involves more than one funding ratio.  In such instances, the other columns are also to be used.\nIn addition, recipients should round all figures to the nearest dollar; that is, amounts of $0.50 or over would be rounded to the higher dollar.  For example: if the other than federal share is computed to be $2,572.70, the amount reported would be $2,573.\nb. Block #5\u2014All requisitions should be numbered consecutively beginning with #1 as the first requisition.  Suggested format should include the fiscal year and sequential number for each individual voucher.  For example, the payment request number for the\nrecipient\u2019s first voucher submitted in FY 2016 would appear on the SF-270 as follows: 2016\u2013001.\nc. Block #8\u2014The first requisition covers the date the federal assistance was awarded (unless the project had pre-award authority, through the end of the period for which reimbursement is requested).  When a requisition requests reimbursement only, the \u201cending\u201d date will be the same date on which outlays are reported on line 11a of this form.  If the reimbursement and/or an advance is being requested, the \u201cending\u201d date should reflect the period through which the advance is needed.\nAll requisition report periods should run consecutively.  For example, if a requisition is submitted for the period 1/1/16 to 3/31/16, the next requisition will begin 4/1/16.\nd. Block #9\u2014The name of the recipient should be exactly as indicated on the Grant Agreement, Cooperative Agreement, or Other Agreement.  Recipients should avoid abbreviation and spell out the entire name of the organization.\ne. Block #11\u2014Line A\u2014The \u201cas of\u201d date should be the date for which the recipient has actual costs recorded.  This date should be the same as the \u201cto\u201d date, Block #8, unless the recipient is requesting an advance.   (1) Line B\u2014Represents the amount applicable to program income that was required to be used for the project or program by terms of the Grant Agreement, Cooperative Agreement, or Other Agreement.\n(2) Line D\u2014Represents the estimated expenditures for the advance period, both the FTA share and the non-federal share.\n(3) Line F\u2014The non-federal share of line E, depending on the funding ratio of a particular project.\n(4) Line G\u2014The federal share of line E, depending on the funding ratio for a particular project.\n(5) Line H\u2014The total of previous requisition(s) submitted.  This line should not represent actual payment received because the recipient may have submitted a requisition that is in the process of being paid.  Requisition #1 on this line should be zero.\nNote that the recipient should complete only the \u201ctotal\u201d column of Block #11, unless the Grant Agreement, Cooperative Agreement, or Other Agreement specified that there is more than one funding source supporting the project.  In such cases, separate columns should be utilized for each funding source.\n(6) Line I\u2014The federal share now requested represents the total amount of the SF-270 reimbursement that will be forwarded to the recipient.\n3. REVIEW OF THE SF-270.  Each SF-270 for federal assistance will be reviewed in light of the periodic milestone progress reports (MPRs) and financial reports required for each project.  Changes requiring amendments to the Grant Agreement, Cooperative Agreement, or Other Agreement or prior approval of a revision to the Award Budget must be approved before federal assistance for these changes are requisitioned.\nExhibit 1: ACH Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment Form (SF3881)\n\nInstructions for Completing SF 3881 Form\n\nExhibit 2: Request for Advance or Reimbursement (SF-270)\n\nInstructions for Completing SF-270 Form\nAPPENDIX I:   REPORTING ON REAL PROPERTY INVENTORY\nGENERAL.  The Report on Real Property Inventory must be maintained by the recipient with its files.  The report on real property status should include, at a minimum, the following information:\n1. Parcel Number\n2. Property Address / Location\n3. Tax ID\n4. Description of Real Property\n5. Date of Property Acquisition\n6. Minimum Useful Life of the Improvement\n7.

THE FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION (FTA).  FTA is one of ten operating administrations within the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).  Headed by an administrator appointed by the President of the United States, FTA functions through a Washington, DC, headquarters office, 10 regional offices, and 6 metropolitan offices that assist transit agencies in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa and federally recognized Indian tribes.\nAs defined in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5302, \u201cpublic transportation,\u201d means regular, continuing shared-ride surface transportation services that are open to the general public or open to a segment of the general public defined by age, disability, or low income.  Public transportation generally includes, but is not limited to, transportation services provided by buses, heavy rail, light rail, commuter rail, fixed guideway, bus rapid transit, passenger ferryboats, trolleys, inclined railways, people movers, vans, streetcars, jitneys, and aerial tramways.  Public transportation can be either fixed-route or demand-response service, but excludes intercity passenger rail provided by Amtrak, intercity bus service, charter bus service, school bus service, sightseeing services, courtesy shuttle services provided by individual businesses and intra-terminal or intra-facility shuttle services.  The terms \u201ctransit\u201d and \u201cmass transportation\u201d are used interchangeably with \u201cpublic transportation.\u201d\nThe Federal Government, through FTA, provides financial assistance to develop new transit systems and improve, maintain, and operate existing systems.  FTA oversees thousands of Awards with hundreds of state and local transit providers, primarily through its ten regional offices.  Recipients and subrecipients of federal assistance for these projects are responsible for managing their programs in accordance with federal requirements.  FTA is responsible for ensuring that recipients and subrecipients follow federal statutory and administrative requirements. FTA is also authorized to establish national standards and requirements, to conduct necessary safety oversight, and to issue directives to ensure the safety of the nation\u2019s public transportation systems.\n2. AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION AND GUIDANCE.  Most federal transit laws are codified in 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.  Authorizing legislation is substantive legislation enacted by Congress that establishes or continues the legal operation of a federal program or agency.  Congress typically amends FTA\u2019s authorizing legislation every four to six years.  FTA\u2019s most recent authorizing legislation is the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act programs, Public Law 114-94, signed into law on December 4, 2015, with an effective date of October 1, 2015.\nThe Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) authorized FTA programs for FY 2013 through FY 2015, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) authorized FTA programs from FY 2005 through FY 2012.  Changes have been added to this circular to reflect FAST and MAP-21 changes to federal transit law and changes required by other laws that have become effective since the circular was last published in 2012.\nThe circular revision also incorporates provisions of the Office of Management and Budget, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d (referred to as the Uniform Guidance), 2 CFR part 200.  The Uniform Guidance, 2 CFR part 200, supersedes and streamlines the administrative and cost principles provisions of requirements from former OMB Circulars A-21, A-87, A-102, A-110, and A-122, administrative requirements.  The Uniform Guidance also supersedes former OMB Circulars A-89, pertaining to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, and former OMB Circulars A-133, which addressed the Single Audit Act, and A-50, which addressed Single Audit Act follow-up.\nU.S. DOT regulations, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d 2 CFR part 1201, supersedes and replaces the requirements of the DOT Common Rule, former 49 CFR parts 18 and 19, except that former 49 CFR parts 18 and 19 will continue to apply to Grant and Cooperative Agreements awarded before December 26, 2014, as in effect on the date of such Grant or Cooperative Agreements (See information below for further clarity).\nThe final guidance consolidates the guidance previously contained in the aforementioned regulations and circulars into a streamlined format that aims to improve both the clarity and accessibility.  DOT\u2019s Common Rule, 2 CFR part 1201, incorporates the OMB Uniform Guidance by reference and makes that guidance part of the DOT regulation.  The OMB final Uniform Guidance is located in 2 CFR, part 200.  Copies of 2 CFR part 200 and the former OMB Circulars that are superseded by this guidance are available on OMB\u2019s Web site at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_default.\n3. HOW TO CONTACT FTA.  FTA\u2019s regional and metropolitan offices are responsible for the provision of financial assistance to FTA recipients and subrecipients and oversight of project implementation for most FTA programs.  Certain programs are the responsibility of FTA Headquarters.  Inquiries should be directed to either the regional or metropolitan office responsible for the geographic area in which you are located.  See Appendix K of this circular for additional information.\nVisit the FTA Web site (www.transit.dot.gov) or contact FTA Headquarters at the following address and phone number:\nFederal Transit Administration\nOffice of Communication and Congressional Affairs\n1200 New Jersey Avenue SE.\nRoom E56\u2013205\nWashington, DC 20590\nPhone: 202-366-4043\nFax: 202-366-3472\n4. GRANTS.GOV.  FTA posts all competitive federal assistance opportunities on Grants.gov.  Grants.gov is the one Web site for information on all discretionary federal assistance agreement opportunities.  More information about Grants.gov is available at www.grants.gov.\n5. DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS.  All definitions in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5302 and 2 CFR part 200, subpart A apply to this circular, as well as the following definitions and acronyms: a. Definitions. (1) Accrual Basis of Accounting: The accrual basis of accounting means the accounting method in which income is recorded when earned instead of when received, and expenses are recorded when incurred instead of when paid.\n(2) Acquisition Cost: Acquisition cost means the cost of the asset including the cost to prepare the asset for its intended use.  The acquisition cost for equipment, for example, means the net invoice price of the equipment, including the cost of any modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make it usable for the purpose for which it is acquired.  Acquisition costs for software include those development costs capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  Ot", "doc_id": "94f8f600-d3a2-4798-bc35-d32f38def3ab", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "43581c0d-1355-4bfc-9ae3-408953556d13": {"text": "her charges such as the cost of inspection, installation, transportation, taxes, duty or protective in-transit insurance should be treated in accordance with the applicant or recipient\u2019s regular accounting practices, as separate line items.  The cost of items separately installed and removable from rolling stock, such as fareboxes and radios, is treated as a separate acquisition and not as part of the cost of the vehicle if not included in the procurement of rolling stock.\n(3) Activity Line Item (ALI): Activity Line Item means the detailed description narrative and dollar amount to more fully explain the scope of work of that activity.  Every ALI is associated with a specific Scope Code; the relationship between scope codes and ALIs is outlined in FTA\u2019s \u201cALI Tree.\u201d A sufficient level of information must be provided for each ALI for FTA and the recipient to manage activities approved as part of the Award.\n(4) Administrative Amendment: Administrative amendment means a minor change to an Award initiated by FTA to modify or clarify certain terms, conditions, or provisions of a Grant or Cooperative Agreement.\n(5) Administrative Settlement: Administrative settlement means a settlement in which: (1) the purchase price for property may exceed the amount offered as just compensation when reasonable efforts to negotiate an agreement at that amount have failed, and (2) an authorized federal agency official approves such an arrangement.  The arrangement must be reasonable, prudent, and in the public interest.\n(6) Advance Payment: Advance payment means a payment that a federal awarding agency or pass-through entity makes by any appropriate payment mechanism, including a predetermined payment schedule, before the recipient or subrecipient disburses the funds for program purposes.\n(7) Air Rights:  Air rights mean the space located above the surface of the ground, lying within a project\u2019s property limits.\n(8) Allocation: Allocation means the process of assigning a cost, or a group of costs, to one or more cost objectives, in reasonable proportion to the benefit provided or other equitable relationship.  The process may entail assigning one or more costs directly to a final cost objective or through one or more intermediate cost objectives.\n(9) Amendment: Amendment means the modification of a Grant or Cooperative Agreement that includes a change in scope of work and/or change in federal assistance, as approved by FTA.\n(10) Applicant: In this circular, the term \u201capplicant\u201d is used to identify an entity that is seeking, but has not yet been awarded, specific federal assistance directly from FTA in the form of a Grant or Cooperative Agreement.\n(11) Application: An application means a complete application submitted to FTA for an Award of federal assistance to an eligible recipient in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the Federal Government through a Grant or Cooperative Agreement.\n(12) Associated Transit Improvement: An associated transit improvement (formerly referred to as \u201cTransit Enhancements\u201d) means, with respect to any project or an area to be served by a project, projects that are designed to enhance public transportation service or use and that are physically or functionally related to transit facilities.  Eligible projects are: (1) historic preservation, rehabilitation, and operation of historic public transportation buildings, structures, and facilities (including historic bus and railroad facilities) intended for use in public transportation service; (2) bus shelters; (3) functional landscaping that serves a purpose other than aesthetic, including, but not limited to : erosion control; storm water drainage; mitigating the effects of weather on passengers, including the provision of shade and windscreen; (4) streetscaping, including benches, trash receptacles, and streetlights; (5) pedestrian access and walkways; (6) bicycle access, including bicycle storage shelters and parking facilities and the installation of equipment for transporting bicycles on public transportation vehicles; (7) signage; or (8) enhanced access for persons with disabilities to public transportation.  The FAST Act prohibits grants or loans to be used to pay incremental costs of incorporating art or non-functional landscaping into facilities, including the cost of an artist on the design team.\nLandscaping can be used to aid in the absorption or drainage of rainwater, prevention of erosion, support of structures on a steep grade, minimization of noise impacts, protection of habitat, provision of shade in hot climates, channeling of pedestrian or vehicle traffic, definition of useable or unsafe spaces, and many other purposes.  In interpreting the term \u201cfunctional landscaping\u201d under this provision of law, FTA draws a similar distinction, as with art, between functionally appropriate landscape design and landscape elements installed primarily for visual or aesthetic appeal.\nFor example, an eligible landscaping expense would include the installation of shade trees near a passenger station entrance.  Likewise, FTA would allow the use of grant funds to install dense shrubs surrounding the area containing the transit system\u2019s electrical equipment.  FTA would expect the grantee to select particular varieties of trees and shrubs that are well suited for the particular location and climate.\n(13) Audit Finding: Audit finding means the deficiencies that the auditor is required to report in the schedule of findings and questioned costs as required by 2 CFR \u00a7 200.516(a).\n(14) Auditee: Auditee means any recipient or subrecipient that expends federal assistance that must be audited as required under 2 CFR \u00a7 200, subpart F.\n(15) Auditor: Auditor means a public accountant or a federal, state or local government or Indian tribe audit organization that meets the general standards specified in Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS); as required for the purpose of conducting Single Audits, (See 2 CFR \u00a7 200.7).  The term auditor does not include internal auditors of nonprofit organizations.  Auditor may also mean an individual that performs other non-financial audits, as deemed necessary by FTA.\n(16) Award: Award means the federal assistance FTA has provided to the Recipient to carry out the Scope of Work that FTA has approved.  The Award also includes the requirements of all documents, terms, and conditions incorporated by reference and made part of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.\n(17) Award Budget: Award Budget means the budget for all the Projects encompassed by the FTA Award.  It may include the federal and non-federal share or only the federal share, as determined by FTA or a pass-through entity.\n(18) Brownfields: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines \u201cbrownfields\u201d as real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.  These properties have lower levels of contamination than Superfund sites, but they are still a health risk and economic detriment to the communities where they are located.\n(19) Budget Revision: Budget revision means any change of budget allocations within the Award and the overall Award Budget that has minor impact on the budget allocations of the original Grant or Cooperative Agreement.   (20) Capital Asset: Capital asset means a unit of rolling stock, land, a facility, a unit of equipment, an element of infrastructure, or intellectual property (including software), with a useful life of more than one year that are capitalized in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  Capital asset also includes an addition, improvement, modification, replacement, rearrangement, reinstallation, renovation, or alterations to capital assets that materially increase the value of the asset (apart from ordinary repairs and maintenance.)\n(21) Capital Expenditures: Capital expenditures means expenditures to acquire capital assets or expenditures to make additions, improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements, reinstallations, renovations, or alterations to capital assets that materially increase their value or useful life.\n(22) Capital Lease: Capital lease means any transaction in which the recipient acquires the right to use a capital asset without obtaining full ownership, regardless of the tax status of the transaction.  For purposes of section 3019 of the FAST Act, however, capital lease means any agreement under which a recipient acquires the right to use rolling stock or related equipment for a specified period of time, in exchange for a periodic payment.\n(23) Capital Project: Capital project means a category of reimbursable projects that includes all activities identified in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5302(3).\n(24) Cash Basis of Accounting: The cash basis of accounting is the method in which revenue is recorded when received, rather than when earned, and expenses are recorded when paid, rather than when incurred.  FTA does not permit recipients to prepare their Federal Financial Reports (FFR) using the cash method of accounting.\n(25) Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance: The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) is a Government-wide compendium of federal programs, projects, services, and activities that provide assistance or benefits to the American public.  It contains financial and nonfinancial assistance programs administered by departments and establishments of the Federal Government.  The CFDA number assigned to each program is used to report and track audit findings related to federal Grants and Cooperative Agreements.\n(26) Claim: Claim means, depending on the context, either: (1) a written demand or written assertion by one of the parties to a federal Award seeking as a matter of right: (a) the payment of money in a sum certain, (b) the adjustment or interpretation of the terms and conditions of the federal Award, or (c) other relief arising under or rel", "doc_id": "43581c0d-1355-4bfc-9ae3-408953556d13", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "e9de6b0f-f2ea-430a-a23c-26fc1eb4f192": {"text": "ating to a federal Award; or (2) a request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted.\n(27) Closeout: Closeout means the process by which FTA, or pass-through entity, determines that the scope of work of the federal Award and all applicable administrative actions, including actions described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.343, have been met or FTA has determined the Award should be terminated.   (28) Cluster of Programs: A cluster of programs means a grouping of closely-related programs that share common compliance requirements.  A cluster of programs must be considered as one program for determining major programs, as described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.518 and, with the exception of Research and Development, as described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.501(c), to determine whether a program-specific audit may be elected.\n(29) Cognizant Agency for Audit: The cognizant agency for audit is the federal agency designated to carry out the responsibilities described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.513(a).  The cognizant agency for audit is not necessarily the same as the cognizant agency for indirect costs.  A list of cognizant agencies for audit may be found at the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) Web site.\n(30) Cognizant Agency for Indirect Costs: The cognizant agency for indirect costs is the federal agency responsible for reviewing, negotiating, and approving cost allocation plans, or indirect cost proposals, developed on behalf of all federal agencies.  The cognizant agency for indirect costs is not necessarily the same as the cognizant agency for audit.

In this circular FTA uses the term \u201cgrantee\u201d interchangeably with \u201crecipient,\u201d \u201cgrant recipient,\u201d and \u201cdirect recipient.\u201d\n(74) Idle Capacity: Idle capacity means the unused capacity of partially used facilities.  Idle capacity is the difference between that which a facility could achieve under 100 percent operating time, on a one-shift basis, less operating interruptions resulting from time lost for repairs, setups, unsatisfactory materials, and other normal delays and the extent to which the facility was actually used to meet demands during the accounting period.\n(75) Idle Facility: Idle facility means completely unused facilities that are excess to the recipient\u2019s current needs.\n(76) Incidental Use: Incidental use means the limited authorized non-transit use of project property acquired with FTA assistance.  Such use must not conflict with the approved ", "doc_id": "871aca87-7742-498b-9bc6-5a66a1799809", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "034ec15b-8e69-4a29-ac9f-835e79c5ed78": {"text": "purposes of the project and must not interfere with the intended transit uses of the project property.

First, once an acquisition case is referred to legal counsel to initiate condemnation proceedings, a settlement between the parties may occur before a condemnation complaint is filed.  The second situation, involves the settlement of a case after the condemnation action has been filed.  This may be referred to as a legal or stipulated settlement.  In this case a stipulation agreement is prepared and signed by the parties involved after which the court may approve or issue an order approving the stipulation agreement and dismissing the court case.  In either case such a settlement would necessarily be justified in writing similarly to an administrative settlement as described in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(i) of the URA regulations.

The Act established the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and established national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of the environment; and provides a process for implementing these goals within the federal agencies.  While many different federal laws, rules, and regulations govern environmental review of federal actions, NEPA established an umbrella process for coordinating environmental compliance.  Therefore, NEPA is the primary law governing the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s (FTA) environmental protection process, as implemented through the FHWA/FTA joint regulations found at 23 CFR part 771 and 49 CFR part 622.\n(98) Net Present Value: Net present value means the discounted monetized value of expected net benefits (i.e., benefits minus costs).

GENERAL.  This circular provides requirements and procedures for management of all applicable Federal Transit Administration (FTA) programs authorized under 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.\nFTA implements DOT regulations, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d 2 CFR part 1201, which incorporates by reference U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d 2 CFR part 200, for Awards made on and after December 26, 2014, and former 49 CFR parts 18 and 19 for Awards made before December 26, 2014.  Both 2 CFR part 1201 and former 49 CFR part 18 have specific provisions for certain state control of the administration of equipment, procurement, and financial management.  State requirements apply to those programs that have states as recipients, including 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5305, 5310, 5311, former Section 5316, and former Section 5317.  These state requirements also apply to States that receive federal assistance under other FTA programs for which both state and non-state entities are eligible.\n2. APPLICABLE PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS.  FTA provides formula and discretionary funding under a variety of programs by awarding federal assistance to eligible recipients through a Grant Agreement or Cooperative Agreement.  While this circular contains the post-award guidance for all applicable FTA programs, several of the programs described below have individual program circulars that contain pre-award instructions, project management guidance, and unique administrative requirements that apply to the Award.  Additionally, recipients of funding under the Public Transportation Innovation Program (Sections 5312) and the Technical Assistance and Workforce Development Program (Section 5314) should reference the most current edition of FTA Circular 6100 \u201cResearch, Technical Assistance and Training Program: Application Instructions and Program Management Guidelines\u201d rather than this Circular.\nIf there is a conflict between FTA Circular 5010.1 and program specific circulars, program specific circulars should prevail.  Please reference FTA\u2019s public Web site at www.fta.dot.gov for a complete listing of FTA programs and their current FTA circulars.\nNew and Revised Programs Under MAP-21 or the FAST Act:\na. Metropolitan Planning and Statewide Planning and Research Programs (Section 5305(d) and (e) to implement Section 5303 and Section 5304).\nThese programs provide federal assistance to support cooperative, continuous, and comprehensive planning for making transportation investment decisions in metropolitan areas and statewide.\nFor planning activities that:\n(1) Support the economic vitality of the metropolitan area, especially by enabling global competitiveness, productivity, and efficiency;\n(2) Increase the safety of the transportation system for motorized and nonmotorized users;\n(3) Increase the security of the transportation system for motorized and nonmotorized users;\n(4) Increase the accessibility and mobility of people and freight;\n(5) Protect and enhance the environment, promote energy conservation, improve the quality of life, and promote consistency between transportation improvements and state and local planned growth and economic development patterns;\n(6) Enhance the integration and connectivity of the transportation system, across and between modes, for people and freight;\n(7) Promote efficient system management and operation;\n(8) Emphasize the preservation of the existing transportation system; and\n(9) Improve the resiliency and reliability of the transportation system.\nFederal assistance is apportioned annually by a formula to states that include consideration of each state\u2019s urbanized area population in proportion to the urbanized area population for the entire nation as well as other factors.  States receive no less than 0.5 percent of the amount apportioned.  These funds are sub-allocated by states to Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) by a formula that considers each MPO\u2019s urbanized area population, their individual planning needs, and a minimum distribution.  For more information, please refer to the Joint Planning Regulations at 49 CFR part 613 and the most recent edition of FTA Circular 8100.1.  To be eligible for federal assistance under these programs, projects and related activities must be proposed through the applicable transportation planning process.\nb. Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307), including a Passenger Ferry Grant Program (Section 5307(h)).\nThe Urbanized Area Formula Program makes federal resources available to urbanized areas for transit planning, capital, and operating assistance in urbanized areas.  An urbanized area is an area encompassing a population of not less than 50,000 people that has been defined and designated in the most recent decennial census as an \u201curbanized area\u201d by the Secretary of Commerce.\nFor urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more (as determined by the Bureau of the Census), federal assistance for the Urbanized Area Formula Program is\napportioned and flows directly to a designated recipient(s) selected by the governor, responsible local officials, and publicly owned operators of public transportation to receive and apportion urbanized area formula assistance.  For urbanized areas under 200,000 in population, the funds are apportioned to the governor of each state for distribution, unless such an area has been designated as a transportation management area at the request of the governor and the MPO.  These areas also receive apportionments directly.  Guidance for Section 5307 is found in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9030.1.  To be eligible for Awards under this program, projects and related activities must be proposed through the applicable transportation planning process and contained in a local Transportation Improvement Plan and State Transportation Improvement Plan.  A competitive Passenger Ferry Grant Program is also established under Section 5307(h).\nAdditional information about the Urbanized Area Formula Program, including the Passenger Ferry Grant Program is available in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9030.1.\nc. Fixed Guideway Capital Investment Program \u2013 New and Small Starts and Core Capacity Improvements (Section 5309).\nThe Fixed Guideway Capital Investment Grants Program is a discretionary grant program that finances the construction of new fixed guideway systems or extensions to existing fixed guideway systems, corridor-based BRT projects, and, as amended by MAP-21 and the FAST Act, projects that will expand the capacity of existing fixed guideway corridors that are at capacity or will be in five years.  States and local governmental authorities are eligible applicants for federal assistance under Section 5309.\nProjects become candidates for Awards under this program by successfully completing steps in the process defined in Section 5309 and obtaining a satisfactory rating under the statutorily defined criteria.  For New Starts and Core Capacity Improvement projects, the steps in the process include project development, engineering, and construction.  For Small Starts projects, the steps in the process include project development and construction.  New Starts and Core Capacity Improvement projects receive construction funds from the program through a full funding grant agreement (FFGA) that defines the scope of work of the project and specifies the total multiyear federal commitment to the project.  Small Starts projects receive construction funds through a single year Grant or an expedited Small Starts Grant Agreement that defines the scope of work of the project and specifies the federal commitment to the project.\nAdditional information about the Fixed Guideway Capital Investment Program is available on FTA\u2019s Web site in Capital Investment Grant Program Interim Policy Guidance, published in June 2016, and in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9300.1.\nd. Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities Formula Program (Section 5310).\nThe goal of the Section 5310 program is to improve mobility for seniors and individuals with disabilities throughout the country by removing barriers to transportation services\nand expanding the transportation mobility options available.  Toward this goal, FTA provides financial assistance for transportation services planned, designed, and carried out to meet the special transportation needs of seniors and individuals with disabilities in all areas\u2014large urbanized, small urbanized, and rural.  The program requires coordination with other federally assisted programs and services in order to make the most efficient use of federal resources.\nGuidance on the Section 5310 program is contained in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9070.1, \u201cEnhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities Program Guidance and Application Instructions.\u201d\ne. Rural Areas Formula Program (Section 5311).\nThe Rural Areas Formula Program is a formula grant program that provides capital, planning, and operating assistance to states and Indian tribes to support public transportation in rural areas with populations of less than 50,000, where many residents often rely on public transportation to reach their destinations.  FTA apportions funds under this program to the governor or the governor\u2019s designee.

Tribal Transit Program.\nThe Tribal Transit Program includes a $30 million formula program and continues a $5 million competitive program.  Formula factors include vehicle revenue miles and the number of low-income individuals residing on tribal lands.  Discretionary funds are allocated based on criteria established for the program.  Eligible direct recipients are federally recognized Indian tribes in rural areas.  The funds are to be allocated for grants to Indian tribes for any purpose eligible under Section 5311, which includes capital, operating, planning, job access and reverse commute projects, and administrative assistance for rural public transportation services and rural intercity bus service.\ng. Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Formula Program.\nThis program is financed from amounts made available to carry out Section 5311 and provides formula funds to support public transportation for states in the Appalachian region.  Federal assistance is allocated for any purpose eligible under Section 5311.  Additional information on the Section 5311 Rural Area Formula Program is available in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9040.1.\nh. Bus Testing Facility Program (Section 5318).\nSubsections 5318(a) \u2013 (d) authorizing the Bus Testing Facility remain in effect under the FAST Act.  Section 5318 continues support for the Bus Testing Facility for: (1) testing of new bus models, (2) operating and maintaining the facility, (3) collecting fees for the\ntesting of vehicles, and (4) paying for testing new bus models (which include older bus models that have been produced with a major change in configuration or components) for maintainability, reliability, safety, performance (including braking performance), structural integrity, fuel economy, emissions, and noise performance characteristics.\nMAP-21 expanded subsection 5318(e), Acquiring New Bus Models to include: (1) General requirements, and (2) bus test \u201cpass/fail\u201d standard requirements.\nNew bus models must now meet performance standards listed in subsection 5318(e) and meet performance standards established by DOT under the new safety authority in subsection 5329(b).  Subsection 5318(e) also requires that DOT issue, by rulemaking, a pass/fail bus testing standard.  Only bus models that receive a passing score may be purchased with 49 U.S.C. chapter 53 funds.  Under the rulemaking, a passing score is not to be interpreted as a warranty or guarantee to bus purchasers that the new bus model will meet their specific requirements.\ni. Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program (Section 5324).\nMAP-21 authorized the Section 5324 Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program (ER program).  The ER program authorizes FTA to make grants to public transportation agencies that have experienced serious damage to transit assets as a result of an emergency.  Emergency is defined as a natural disaster that affects a wide area, such as a flood, hurricane, tidal wave, earthquake, severe storm, or landslide, or a catastrophic failure from an external cause, as a result of which the governor of a state has declared an emergency and the Secretary of Transportation has concurred, or the President of the United States has declared a major disaster.\nFTA may make grants under the ER program for capital projects to protect, repair, reconstruct, or replace equipment and facilities of a public transportation system that the Secretary determines are in danger of suffering serious damage or have suffered serious damage as a result of a declared emergency.  In addition, FTA may reimburse operating expenses that are outside the scope of work of an affected recipient\u2019s normal operations, including but not limited to evacuations, rescue operations, bus, ferry, or rail service to replace inoperable service or to detour around damaged areas, temporary service to accommodate an influx of passengers or evacuees, returning evacuees to their homes after the disaster or emergency, and the net project costs related to reestablishing, expanding, or relocating public transportation service before, during, or after an emergency or major disaster.\nGrants under this program, or those made under Sections 5307 or 5311 to address a declared emergency are subject to the terms and conditions that FTA determines are necessary.  FTA will not provide federal assistance for any expenses that are reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\nThe ER program is implemented by regulation under 49 CFR part 602, \u201cEmergency Relief.\u201d Guidance on the ER program is found in the most current version of the FTA Emergency Relief Manual.\nj. Public Transportation Safety Program (Section 5329).\nThe Public Transportation Safety Program, Section 5329, requires DOT to create and implement a national safety plan for all public transportation system recipients of 49 U.S.C. chapter 53 funds.  In this section, \u201crecipient\u201d means a state or local governmental authority, or any other operator of a public transportation system, that receives financial assistance under 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.\nThis section defines the content of the National Public Transportation Safety Plan, establishes a DOT transit safety certification training program, and requires public transit agencies to establish a comprehensive agency safety plan that identifies and seeks to minimize risk, sets safety performance and state of good repair targets, and includes a comprehensive training program.\nSection 5329 also establishes the State Safety Oversight (SSO) program for states operating rail transit systems other than commuter rail.  This subsection grants states three years to establish an approved SSO program with adequately trained staff to oversee rail fixed guideway safety, and to establish a State Safety Oversight Agency.  The legislation also requires that SSO agencies be empowered with oversight, investigative, auditing, and enforcement authority, and be independently funded, i.e., transit agencies are prohibited from funding the SSO agency; funds must be derived from an independent agency.\nSection 5329 authorizes federal oversight of rail transit safety (SSO program) and vests DOT with oversight, investigative, inspection, subpoena, and enforcement powers.\nAdditional information on the Section 5329, Public Transportation Safety Program, is available through the FTA Safety and Oversight Office.\nk. State of Good Repair Formula Program (Section 5337).\nThe State of Good Repair Grants Program is authorized by 49 U.S.C. 5337.  The Secretary may make grants under this section to assist state and local governmental authorities to develop and implement a transit asset management plan (TAM).  Other grants under this section provide financial assistance for in capital projects to maintain public transportation systems in a state of good repair, including projects to replace and rehabilitate: rolling stock, track, line equipment, structures, signals, communications, power equipment, power substations, passenger stations, passenger terminals, security equipment, and security systems; maintenance facilities and maintenance equipment; operational support equipment, including computer hardware and software; and other replacement and rehabilitation projects the Secretary determines appropriate.  Additional information on the Section 5337 State of Good Repair Formula Program is available in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 5300.1, \u201cState of Good Repair Grant Program: Guidance and Application Instructions.\u201d\nl. Buses and Bus Facilities Program (Section 5339).\nThe Grants for Buses and Bus Facilities program (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5339) makes federal assistance available to states and eligible recipients to replace, rehabilitate and purchase buses and related equipment and to construct bus-related facilities including technological changes or innovations to modify low or no emission vehicles or facilities.\nFunding is provided through formula allocations and competitive grants.  A sub-program provides competitive Awards for bus and bus facility projects that support low and zero-emission vehicles.\nFunding under the Award can be made available to eligible recipients (and their subrecipients) that operate fixed route bus and/or demand response services or that allocate funding to fixed route bus and/or demand response operators, state or local governmental entities, and federally recognized Indian tribes that operate fixed route bus service that are eligible to receive direct grants under Sections 5307 and 5311.\nAdditional information on the Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities Formula Program, including transfer provisions to Section 5307, can be found in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 5100.1, \u201cBus and Bus Facilities Program: Guidance and Application Instructions.\u201d\nm. Transit-Oriented Development Planning Pilot Program.\nThe Transit-Oriented Development Planning Pilot Program was established by Section 20005(b) of MAP-21.  This program provides federal assistance to advance planning efforts that support transit-oriented development (TOD) associated with new fixed guideway and core capacity improvement projects, as defined under Section 5309.  TOD focuses growth around transit stations to improve the resiliency and reliability of the transportation system, promote ridership, promote affordable housing near transit, revitalize downtown centers and neighborhoods, and encourage local economic development, tourism, and natural risk reduction.\nFederal assistance under Section 5307 may be used to support planning projects that receive federal assi", "doc_id": "ecdbfeef-9e8e-4c3c-afd8-4f1f8ea361e5", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "cd158079-0026-4da0-a25f-eaf53278b447": {"text": "stance under this program, or may be used for capital projects relating to TOD projects.\nn.

CROSS-CUTTING REQUIREMENTS.  The recipient understands and agrees that it must comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and requirements, except to the extent that FTA determines otherwise, in writing.\nADMINISTRATION OF THE AWARD\n1. OVERVIEW.  This chapter discusses the mechanics and requirements for post-award administration of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement (Award) after the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has awarded federal assistance and the recipient has executed the Grant Agreement or Cooperative Agreement in FTA\u2019s Transit Award Management System (TrAMS).  This chapter emphasizes the requirements associated with administering and managing an Award.  Project management and asset management requirements are described in Chapter IV.\nThe Award Life Cycle is as follows:\na. Award application developed and transmitted to FTA,\nb. Initial reviews completed,\nc. Application determined to be complete,\nd. Award number assigned,\ne. Application submitted to FTA,\nf. Signoffs and Approvals,\ng. Award funds reserved,\nh. Funds obligated (or awarded) by FTA,\ni. Award executed by recipient,\nj. Award implemented, monitored and managed, and\nk. Award closed.\nIn order to better understand the sequence of actions and the related administrative requirements, the life cycle leading to an Award is outlined in broad terms, with the pre-award and post-award phases separated.\nDuring the pre-award phase, FTA performs various actions, including soliciting applications (whether formally through a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) or informally), reviewing and selecting successful proposals, as well as creating administrative and fiscal accounts, such as assigning the Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN), other reference numbers, and reserving federal assistance.  The applicant is responsible for drafting a proposal in response to the requirements of the solicitation, preparing related documents, and submitting the application in TrAMS.  The pre-award phase ends when FTA obligates (awards) federal assistance for the project(s), and related activities, to be supported through\nthe Award of the Grant Agreement or Cooperative Agreement, as described in the application.  The recipient then executes the Award.\nOnce the Award is executed, the applicant becomes the recipient and the post-award phase begins.  During this phase, the recipient implements each project and related activities supported under its Award, administers its Award based on the terms and conditions identified in the Grant Agreement or Cooperative Agreement that accompany the Award, and works with FTA to complete the Award within its Award Budget and on schedule.  FTA is responsible for monitoring the Award and assisting in the effective management of the terms of the accompanying Grant Agreement or Cooperative Agreement, including reviewing required reports and Award modification requests.\nOnce the period of performance, as referenced in the Award, has ended, the closeout of the Award can begin.  The Award is considered closed when the recipient has completed and submitted the documents required for closeout in TrAMS and FTA has accepted these documents.  These documents and reports include the recipient\u2019s final reconciled budget and final Federal Financial Report (FFR) and Milestone Progress Report (MPR) in TrAMS.  Records should be maintained as provided in the established retention schedule, see Section 7 of this Chapter, \u201cRetention and Access Requirements for Records.\u201d\n2. APPLICATION PROCESS.  FTA\u2019s program-specific circulars describe the Award application process and requirements.  Refer to these circulars for instructions for completing an Award application.  For a full listing of FTA program circulars, as of the date of publication of this circular, see Appendix A of this circular or visit www.fta.dot.gov.\nFTA provides a streamlined electronic interface between recipients and FTA that allows complete electronic application submission, review, approval, and management of all Awards.  This system incorporates field commands found in standard forms, such as SF-424, etc.  The applicant must use TrAMS to apply for federal assistance from FTA, manage its Grant or Cooperative Agreement from Award to Closeout, file the required financial status reports and milestone progress reports, upload applicable civil rights programs, and submit its annual Certifications and Assurances.  Please contact your FTA point of contact for information regarding FTA\u2019s current electronic award management system.\nEach Grant or Cooperative Agreement includes, at a minimum:\na. Description of the overall Award scope of work summarizing each Project and related activities that will receive federal assistance under the Award as stated in the Award Budget;\nb. Separate narrative, budgets, and schedules for each activity supported under the Award;\nc. The Award Budget, consisting of all the costs associated with the scope of work encompassed in the Award;\nd. Any special conditions within the Agreement or incorporated by reference and made part of the Agreement, such as Department of Labor requirements;\ne. The period of performance of the entire Award delineated by the start and end dates of the Award during which time projects and related activities are expected to be completed and the federal assistance expended;\nf. The identification of whether pre-award authority has been exercised for the Award and submission of an initial Federal Financial Report,, if pre-award authority was exercised, and\ng. Any other documents attached to the application, incorporated by reference and made part of each Grant or Cooperative Agreement that apply to the Award including the Master Agreement, the recipient\u2019s Certifications and Assurances submitted each fiscal year, and other relevant documents.\nNote: Once FTA obligates federal assistance through the Award, the applicant must execute the Award in TrAMS within 90 days; otherwise FTA may withdraw its Award.  Once the Award is executed, it is considered \u201cactive\u201d and the recipient must comply with post-award administration requirements.\n3. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  When the Award is active, the recipient must comply with post-award reporting requirements.  FTA\u2019s policy for reporting requirements may vary depending on the size of the recipient or the type or amount of federal assistance the recipient receives.  The Award may include special reporting requirements.  These are typically identified by program and may be included in Federal Register notices, apportionment notices, and program circulars.  Please contact your FTA point of contact with questions regarding the applicability of the following reporting requirements.   a. General Reporting Purpose.  The FTA post-award review may consider whether the following factors are progressing as outlined in the Grant or Cooperative Agreement:  (1) The purposes of the Award are being achieved,\n(2) The Award is progressing as scheduled and within its Award Budget,\n(3) The recipient is demonstrating competence and control in implementing the scope of work encompassed by the Award, and\n(4) The Award meets all program requirements, and all performance measures are being captured.\nFTA monitors projects and related activities under the Award to ensure proper recipient stewardship of federal assistance and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and requirements.  FTA\u2019s monitoring continues throughout the period of performance.  Should a problem develop, FTA may become involved to assist in its resolution.  FTA also must be able to report on program results, industry trends, and its own oversight responsibilities.  Recipients submit the information FTA needs for program forecasting and management through the FFR and narrative MPR detailing progress, significant events, relevant activities, and any changes to or variances in the Award Budget or schedule.\nWith respect to the level of detail required for these reports, FTA treats all approved activity line items (ALIs) alike.  Thus, an activity contained under the Award must be presented in the reports in sufficient detail that important information is not lost in the aggregation.  For example, the number of full-size buses supported under the Award must not be reported together with vans under the scope code for \u201crolling stock,\u201d but instead should be reported separately under the applicable ALI.  FTA staff is available to assist recipients to determine and agree on the appropriate level of reporting detail and formats.  This will ensure that FTA has the information needed to manage its overall program.\nAll recipients should report significant developments or changes as they occur during the year, including any problems, delays, or adverse conditions that may materially impair the ability to meet the objective(s) of the Award, as well as any favorable developments that may enable meeting time schedules and objectives sooner or at a cost substantially lower than expected in the FFRs.  If the Award requires a change in the overall end date of the Agreement,", "doc_id": "23309d75-f74f-43e3-94c0-95146f18cbff", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "7367d68c-32a0-4840-b136-3ca575b70f93": {"text": " the recipient should consult the FTA Regional Office to determine if the change to the overall end date will be made through a budget revision or an amendment. Adjustments to individual activities may be made as part of the MPR.\nRecipients must file their FFRs and MPRs through TrAMS.  Recipients may attach supplemental information accompanying the FFRs and MPRs; however, attachments may not be submitted in lieu of completing and submitting the FFR and MPR via TrAMS.\nFTA may withhold payment for failure to submit either FFRs or MPRs in a timely manner.  In limited instances, FTA may grant extensions of report due dates for good cause.  For recipients that report quarterly, an extension may be granted up to the day prior to the next quarter reporting cycle (for example, a report due on January 30, may receive an extension with a due date no later than March 30.  This is necessary to ensure information is captured for the next reporting cycle beginning on April 1).  Recipients that report annually must report by October 30.  FTA, or the recipient, may request to make modifications to a submitted quarterly or annual report; however, any corrections must be completed and resubmitted within 60 days after the original due date.  Recipients that report annually may be granted an additional 60 days for a justified reason (following the same format for recipients that report quarterly).\nPlease contact your FTA regional or metropolitan office for questions regarding any reporting requirements or report due dates.\nb. Reports of Significant Events.  Unforeseen events that impact the schedule, cost, capacity, usefulness, or purpose of the Award, including the terms and conditions applicable to the Award must be reported to FTA immediately and then reflected in the next Milestone Progress Report.  A separate special reports should be submitted when:  (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions will affect the recipient\u2019s ability to achieve the objectives of the Award within the scheduled time period or Award Budget.  The report should discuss actions taken and/or contemplated and any federal assistance needed to resolve the situation.  If the Award requires a change in the overall end date of the Agreement, the recipient should consult the FTA Regional\nOffice to determine if the change to the overall end date will be made through a budget revision or an amendment.  .\n(2) Favorable developments will enable the recipient to achieve project goals/complete project activities ahead of schedule or at lower cost.\nc. Federal Financial Report (FFR).  FTA\u2019s electronic FFR report is consistent with and includes information identified in OMB\u2019s Standard Form FFR (SF FFR).  A recipient must submit an FFR for each active Award.  The FFR accompanies the MPR (described below) and is used to monitor the federal assistance awarded.  The purpose of the FFR is to provide a current, complete, and accurate financial picture of the Award.  This report is submitted electronically through TrAMS. The first 4 items (A-D) are prepared using cash accounting. The remaining report items (E-U) must be prepared on the accrual basis of accounting; that is, income is recorded when earned instead of when received, and expenses are recorded when incurred instead of when paid.  These items, (E-U) of the FFR, may not be prepared on the cash basis of accounting, even though a recipient may keep its books on the cash basis during its accounting year.  If this is the case, at the submission of the FFR, the recipient must prepare the necessary accruals and submit the FFR on the accrual basis of accounting.  (See Appendix B, \u201cFederal Financial Report\u201d).\nThe FFR must contain the following elements:\n(1) All financial facts (e.g., expenditures and obligations) relating to the Award (scope of work and supporting activities); the purpose of each financial report and applicable reporting period should be completely and clearly displayed in the reports.\n(2) Reported financial data should be accurate to the last Award Budget (this may be the initial Award, or last revision to the Award Budget or amendment to the Award) and the reporting period.  The requirement for accuracy does not rule out inclusion of reasonable estimates when precise measurement is impractical, uneconomical, unnecessary, or conducive to delay.  Financial data reported may reconcile data included in the prior report, and must be explained in the explanation/remarks section of the report.\n(3) Financial reports must be based on the required supporting documentation maintained in the recipient\u2019s official financial management system that produces information that objectively discloses financial aspects of events or transactions.\n(4) Financial data reported should be derived from accounts that are maintained on a consistent, periodic basis; material changes in accounting policies or methods and their effect must be clearly explained.\n(5) Reporting terminology used in financial reports to FTA should be consistent with receipt and expense classifications included in the latest Award.\n(6) The recipient is responsible for indicating whether or not it is charging indirect costs to the Award at the time of application.  If the recipient is charging indirect\ncosts to the Award, the recipient is responsible for having an approved Indirect Cost Rate Proposal or Cost Allocation Plan approved by the cognizant agency on file, and uploading the documentation into their TrAMS \u201cRecipient Profile.\u201d The recipient must report on related indirect expenditures.\n(7) The recipient must provide financial information related to the FFR categories: Federal Cash, Recipient Share, Unliquidated Obligations, and Program Income.\n(8) The recipient must provide remarks to help explain the report, in particular any reconciliation (e.g., refunds) identified in the report.  The recipient must also certify or attest that the information provided is accurate.\nd. Milestone Progress Reports (MPR).  The MPRs must be submitted for each active Award.  The MPR is the primary written communication between the recipient and FTA.  This report must be submitted electronically.  If only operating assistance is included in the Award, the reporting requirements are limited to the actual dates when all federal assistance has been expended.\nThe information provided in MPR reports should be as complete as possible, highlighting progress toward project objectives and any potential problem areas.\nEach MPR must include the following data as appropriate:\n(1) The current status, at a minimum, of each milestone that has passed during the prior reporting period, within an active Award.  FTA, at its discretion, may request a recipient to update each milestone within an active Award.  MPRs should identify: a) The actual completion dates for any milestones completed during the reporting period, and\nb) Any revised dates when any original (or last revised) completion dates were not met.\nc) If the milestone date exceeds the Award end date, the recipient should consult the FTA Regional Office to determine if the change to the Award end date will be made through a budget revision or an amendment.\n(2) A narrative of the activity status, any problems encountered in implementation, specification preparation, bid solicitation, resolution of protests, and third-party contract Awards.\n(3) A detailed discussion of all Award Budget or schedule changes.\n(4) An explanation of why scheduled milestones or completion dates were not met.\n(5) Identification of problem areas and a narrative on how the problems will be solved.\n(6) A discussion of the expected impacts and the efforts to recover from the delays.\n(7) An analysis of each significant project cost variance: Completion and acceptance of equipment and construction or other work should be discussed, together with a breakout of the costs incurred and those costs required to complete the project.  Use quantitative measures, such as hours worked, sections completed, or units delivered.\n(8) A list of all outstanding claims exceeding $100,000, and all claims settled during the reporting period.  This list should be accompanied by a brief description, estimated costs, and the reasons for the claims.\n(9) A list of all potential and executed change orders, as defined in Circular 4220.1, and amounts exceeding $100,000, pending or settled, during the reporting period.  This list should be accompanied by a brief description.  Identification of change orders does not imply notification, acceptance, or approval of budgetary changes that might be required.\n(10) A list of claims or litigation involving third-party contracts and potential third-party contracts that: a) Have a value exceeding $100,000;\nb) Involve a controversial matter, irrespective of amount; or\nc) Involve a highly publicized matter, irrespective of amount.\n(11) A list of all real property acquisition actions, including just compensation, property or properties under litigation, administrative settlements, and condemnation for each parcel during the reporting period.\n(12) All rolling stock ALIs must include a milestone for Contract Award.\ne. Report Due Dates.  For FFRs and MPRs, the following reporting dates apply: (1) Recipients located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more populations.  Recipients located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more populations who receive more than $1 million in funds from FTA, FFRs and MPRs must be submitted and are due to FTA within 30 days after the end of each quarter, i.e., by January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30.  The FTA regional or metropolitan office may request more frequent reporting or additional reports if circumstances warrant additional reporting.\nRecipients located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more populations who receive less than $1 million in funds from FTA, FFRs and MPRs must be submitted and are due October 30, one month after the federal fiscal year (FY) ends.  The FTA regional or metropolitan office may request more fre", "doc_id": "7367d68c-32a0-4840-b136-3ca575b70f93", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "2bba694b-c3a6-4fc4-8108-2a1013f75415": {"text": "quent reporting or additional reports if circumstances warrant additional reporting.\n(2) Recipients located in urbanized areas of less than 200,000 populations.  FFRs and MPRs must be submitted and are due October 30, one month after the federal fiscal year (FY) ends.  The FTA regional or metropolitan office may request more frequent reporting or additional reports if circumstances warrant additional reporting.\n(3) FTA may utilize a risk based approach to change the frequency of reporting requirements for a particular Award or recipient.  This will be noted in the Grant Agreement or Cooperative Agreement.\n(4) Exceptions:  a) Section 5309 Grants: All grant recipients, regardless of location and population area, are required to submit quarterly reports in TrAMS according to the dates in subsection 3.e.(1) above when grants include construction of facility.\nb) State Departments of Transportation (State DOTs): State DOTs are required to report annually for all state administered programs; this includes Sections 5303, 5304, 5307 (Governor\u2019s Apportionment), 5310, 5311, former Section 5316, and former Section 5317 programs.  The exception described in the preceding paragraph applies to the State DOTs.\nc) If the provisions of this FTA Circular 5010.1 differ from the provisions of the applicable FTA Programmatic Circular, the Program Circular takes precedence.  FTA at its discretion may always require more stringent reporting or specialized reports.  Depending on project complexity, at its discretion, FTA may also request other special reports or quarterly project management meetings.\nf. Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) Subaward and Executive Compensation Reporting.  Recipients awarded new federal assistance greater than or equal to $25,000 as of October 1, 2010, are subject to FFATA subaward and executive compensation reporting requirements as outlined in the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s guidance issued August 27, 2010.  These recipients must file an FFATA subaward report by the end of the month following the month in which the recipient awards any subaward greater than or equal to $25,000.  Additionally, all recipients must report the names and compensation of their five most highly compensated officers, and first-tier subrecipients must report the names and compensation of their five most highly compensated officers, if in the preceding fiscal year they received 80 percent or more of their annual gross revenues in federal Awards; and $25,000 or more in annual gross revenues from federal Awards; and the public does not have access to this information about the compensation of the senior executives of those recipients or subrecipients through periodic reports filed under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(a), \u00a7 78o(d), or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\nInstructions and the FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) can be found at: www.fsrs.gov.\ng. Reports and Other Materials Produced by the Recipient.  All reports, presentations, and other products resulting from FTA sponsorship reports (federal assistance or non-financial sponsorship) must contain the following acknowledgment and disclaimer:\nDISCLAIMER NOTICE\nThis document is disseminated under the sponsorship of the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Transit Administration, in the interest of information exchange.  The United States Government assumes no liability for the contents or use thereof.\nThe United States Government does not endorse products or manufacturers.  Any trade or manufacturers\u2019 names appear herein solely because they are considered essential to the contents of the report.\nh. Associated Transit Improvement Reports.  Associated Transit Improvement Reports (also, Transit Enhancement Reports for Awards made before MAP-21 was signed into law) must be submitted by recipients with populations of 200,000 or more that receive federal assistance under the Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307).  Recipients of this federal assistance are required by Section 5307(c)(1)(K) to submit a report listing the associated transit improvement projects carried out during the previous FY with that federal assistance including the amounts expended.  Refer to the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9030.1, \u201cUrbanized Area Formula Program: Program Guidance and Application Instructions,\u201d for reporting requirements.  Certification that the Associated Transit Improvement Report or Transit Enhancement Report has been submitted is required as part of the Annual List of Certifications and Assurances.\ni. Civil Rights Reports.  Recipients, as a prerequisite for federal assistance, must comply with certain civil rights requirements and routinely evaluate if their compliance requirements change. (1) Title VI.  Recipients must submit, on a triennial basis, a report of their compliance with the objectives of the most recent edition of FTA Circular 4702.1, \u201cTitle VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients.\u201d FTA Circular 4702.1 provides details on the contents of compliance reports.\n(2) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program.  Recipients meeting the FTA-assisted contracting threshold at 49 CFR \u00a7 26.21(a)(2) must report on the following DBE program requirements:   a) DBE Program.  Recipients meeting the threshold set forth in 49 CFR \u00a7 26.21(a)(2) must submit to FTA a DBE program that includes all the required elements specified in 49 CFR part 26.  Recipients do not need to submit regular updates of the DBE program once FTA has approved it, however significant changes to the program must be submitted for approval.\nb) DBE Goals.  DBE goal setting requirements apply to recipients that will award cumulative contracts (excluding vehicle purchases) exceeding $250,000 in FTA funds in any given fiscal year.  These recipients are required to provide DBE goals to FTA by August 1 on a triennial basis, and\nc) Uniform Report of DBE Awards or Commitments and Payments.  Recipients for which the DBE goals apply are required to submit the Uniform Report of DBE Awards or Commitments and Payments (the Semi-Annual Report) by June 1 and December 1 of each year.  By June 1, the recipient must report on all FTA-funded contracts awarded and/or completed and ongoing DBE activity for the first half of the federal fiscal year (October 1 to March 31).  By December 1, the recipient must report on all FTA-funded contracts awarded and/or completed and ongoing DBE activity for the second half of the federal fiscal year (April 1 to September 30).  Reports are completed by filling out the reporting form available in FTA\u2019s Electronic Awards Management System.\nd) Reporting Transit Vehicle Manufacturers.  Within 30 days after entering into a contract for any federally-funded transit vehicle purchase, the Recipient must submit to FTA the name of the TVM contractor and the total dollar value of the third-party contract using the online Transit Vehicle Award Reporting Form.  Recipients must also submit the online Transit Vehicle Award Reporting Form within 30 days of exercising an option or a piggyback on an existing contract, or ordering a vehicle from an authorized schedule.  The list of DBE-certified TVMs can be found on FTA\u2019s Web site at https://www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/civil-rights-ada/eligible-transit-vehicle-manufacturers.\nTo the extent that a vehicle remanufacturer is responding to a solicitation for new or remanufactured vehicles with a vehicle to which the remanufacturer has provided post-production alterations or retrofitting (e.g., replacing major components such as an engine to provide a \u201clike new\u201d vehicle), the vehicle remanufacturer is considered a transit vehicle manufacturer.\nFurther instructions for reporting vehicle purchases can be found on FTA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights Web site.\n(3) Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO).  Recipients covered under the most recent edition of FTA Circular 4704.1, which addresses EEO matters, must submit triennial reports on their compliance with this circular.  FTA EEO program reporting requirements apply to State recipients and recipients that employ 100 or more transit-related employees and receive capital or operating assistance in excess of $1 million, or receive $250,000 or more from FTA for planning purposes.  The most recent edition of FTA Circular 4704.1 provides details on the contents of EEO compliance reports.\nj. National Transit Database (NTD) Reporting.  Congress established the NTD to be the Nation\u2019s primary source for information and statistics pertaining to the transit systems within the United States.  NTD data are used to support numerous DOT programs and to \u201chelp meet the needs of individual public transportation systems, the United States Government, state and local governments, and the public for information on which to base public transportation service planning.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5335.\nThe legislative authority for the NTD is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5335.  FTA implemented NTD requirements through the NTD Rule, 49 CFR part 630.  A recipient or subrecipient of federal assistance from FTA that is required to report to the NTD must provide a complete report of all transit operations, regardless of whether those operations are or are not financed in whole or in part by FTA.  Financial information reported to the NTD must be reported in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts (USOA).  The complete reporting requirements for the NTD, along with information on due dates, extensions, and waivers can be found in the current versions of the NTD Reporting Manuals.  The NTD Rule, the USOA, and the latest versions of the NTD Reporting Manuals can be found on FTA\u2019s NTD Web site at www.transit.dot.gov/ntd.\n(1) Applicability. A recipient, subrecipient, or beneficiary of funds from FTA\u2019s Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307) or Rural Areas Formula Program (Section 5311) is required by law to report t", "doc_id": "2bba694b-c3a6-4fc4-8108-2a1013f75415", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "2874b005-d506-4d83-b8b4-7e0c549abb47": {"text": "o the NTD.  In addition, recipients or subrecipients of funds for public transportation services from any other FTA Program, including FTA\u2019s Formula Program for Special Services for the Elderly and Disabled (Section 5310), must complete the asset management reporting requirements.\n(2) Small Systems Waiver. A system that operates 30 or fewer vehicles across all modes in an urbanized area may receive a small systems waiver upon request.  Systems requesting and receiving a small systems waiver have reduced requirements for their annual reports.  In addition, these systems are exempted from the monthly reports and the safety module report.   These systems must still annually report data on sources of revenue, operating expenses, capital expenses, service operations, organizational relationships, safety data, capital assets, and state of good repair performance targets.  These systems are exempt, however, from collecting and reporting data on total passenger miles.\n(3) Annual Reports (Tribes).  An Indian Tribe receiving funds under FTA\u2019s Tribal Transit Program must report annually to the NTD.  The reporting requirements for Tribes are identical to those for the Small Systems Waiver systems listed above.\n(4) Annual Reports (Rural, Other than Tribal Transit). State Departments of Transportation file annual NTD reports on behalf of their subrecipients, except those subrecipients that are otherwise reporting directly to the NTD.  Subrecipients of the Section 5311 Program are required to assist their State DOT in completing the annual NTD reporting requirements.  These requirements are identical to those for Small Systems Waiver systems listed above.\n(5) Annual Reports (Other than Sections 5307 or 5311). Recipients of other grants from FTA for public transportation services to the NTD must annually report organizational information, a capital asset inventory, condition assessments, and state of good repair performance targets.  Recipients of these grants with subrecipients, must report the same information to the NTD on behalf of those subrecipients - this includes Section 5310 subrecipients that provide public transportation services.\n(6) Annual Reports. Recipients of Section 5307 grants that do not receive a small systems waiver must file a full annual report.  The full annual report includes data on sources of revenue, operating expenses, capital expenses, service operations, organizational relationships, total employees, fuel consumption, capital assets, and state of good repair performance targets.\n(7) Monthly Reports. Recipients of Section 5307 grants that do not receive a small systems waiver must file a monthly report on transit operations, including unlinked passenger trips, vehicle revenue miles, vehicle revenue hours, and vehicles operated in maximum service on each mode.\n(8) Safety Reports. Recipients of Section 5307 grants that do not receive a small systems waiver must report safety data to the NTD each month.  A detailed report is required within 30 days of each safety event that meets the major event reporting threshold, including any event with a fatality, significant property damage, or serious injuries, among others.  A summary report is required each month of certain events that do not meet the major event reporting threshold.  Consult the NTD Reporting Manuals for specific requirements.\nk. Quarterly Reports for Major Capital Construction Projects.  Major Capital Construction Projects must submit a quarterly project budget and project schedule and may require additional reporting (See Chapter IV, \u201cDesign and Construction of Facilities Projects.\u201d)\n4. MODIFICATIONS TO THE AWARD.  At times, it may be necessary to modify the Award by revising the Award Budget or amending the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  The recipient is responsible for managing and monitoring each project and related activities under the Award to ensure that all projects and related activities are carried out in accordance with the Award Budget.\nEach federal assistance program has specific requirements that are included in each FTA program circular that should be referenced before contemplating a modification to the Award.  For example, for federal assistance under Section 5307, each associated transit improvement (previously transit enhancement) must be used for activities eligible under the statute authorizing its federal assistance.  Another example is that federal assistance for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) complementary paratransit service as a capital project may not exceed 10 percent, (or in some cases 20 percent, to the extent authorized by federal law) of its annual apportionment under Section 5307 and 5311.  Sections 5310 and 5311 also have specific requirements for modifications to Awards that are addressed in the FTA program application circulars.  Federal assistance flexed from other programs, such as\nthe Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Improvement Program or the Surface Transportation Program (STP), may have additional requirements that are addressed in other guidance that must be considered before modifying the Award.\nThe manner in which the Award Budget is initially structured during the application phase can facilitate or impede project management, particularly when unforeseen events require changes to the Award.\nThere are three ways to modify the Award: (1) through a revision to the Award Budget, (2) through an Administrative Amendment, or (3) through an Amendment.  The recipient should contact the FTA regional or metropolitan office for questions relating to requests for a modification to its Award, including which type of modification is appropriate for the proposed action.  Modifications are electronically submitted, reviewed, and approved in TrAMS.\nAward modifications must be approved in TrAMS to maintain an active Award Budget and Amendment.  An Active Budget is required to ensure the recipient can seek reimbursement consistent with the newly approved changes to the Award Budget.\na. Award Budget Revisions  (1) General.  A revision to the Award Budget may be made as long as there is no change to the purpose and the scope of work and no change to the type of and/or amount of federal assistance awarded, regardless of the FY for which the federal assistance was appropriated.\nWhether a revision to the Award Budget may be permitted or whether an Amendment to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement will be necessary depends on the effect of the proposed change(s).\nThe following items assist in determining if the proposed change is appropriate to be made as an Award budget revision:\na) Revisions to the Award Budget are generally changes to ALI amounts, when the same funding source is applied or when minor adjustments are made to descriptions of activities.  For example, if an ALI is added to an existing scope code to delineate better the existing activities or to reallocate funds between existing ALIs when one ALI has completed its scope of work and a surplus of funds remains available, then a revision to the Award Budget may be appropriate.\nHowever, if the proposed action results in all of the ALIs within a scope code being reduced to zero, and the scope code is, therefore, zeroed out, then the recipient should consult with the Regional Office as to whether the action  may necessitate an amendment.\nb) Revisions to an Award Budget must be consistent with the activities contained in an approved STIP.\nc) Revisions to an Award Budget may not alter the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) determinations pertaining to the current Award.  Note that, the addition of an activity to an existing scope code may be a revision to the Award Budget when it can be satisfied under the current NEPA of the Award, or it has satisfied NEPA independently.\n(2) Procedures.  A revision to an Award Budget must be submitted electronically through TrAMS.  A request for a revision to an Award Budget request must include a reason for the revision.  Any revision to an existing ALI in an Award Budget must be accompanied by a brief explanation to explain the impact of the change on the project, and the Grant or Cooperative Agreement as a whole.  If necessary, additional information may be attached in TrAMS.  The FTA reviewer will return an incomplete revision to an Award Budget to the recipient for inclusion of additional information.\nRevisions to an Award Budget may be performed to active Awards regardless of whether they were initially awarded under an older FTA electronic award management system (i.e., TEAM or TrAMS).\nRevisions to the Award Budget may be sent to the Department of Labor (DOL) for informational purposes but the labor protection arrangements for the original Award will apply to any modifications without further DOL certification.\nIn certain circumstances, a recipient must receive FTA\u2019s prior approval of a revision to an Award Budget before incurring costs.  The request should be made as a revision to an Award Budget in TrAMS and must explain and justify the proposed revision and outline the proposed changes to confirm it is a valid revision to the Award Budget and not an Amendment.  FTA must document its review and concurrence before the recipient can incur costs associated with the proposed change.\nFTA\u2019s prior approval is required when the proposed revision to an Award Budget meets any of the following criteria:\na) The revision results from changes in the scope of work or the objective of the project or program;\nb) Additional federal funds are needed to complete the project;\nc) A revision involves specific costs for which prior written approval is required in accordance with applicable OMB cost principles listed in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E\u2014Cost Principles.\nd) For equipment, when the federal share of the Award exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000, at the time of publication of this circular) and the cumulative amount of change exceeds 20 percent from the latest budget approved by FTA (eithe", "doc_id": "2874b005-d506-4d83-b8b4-7e0c549abb47", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "61c1846b-0a19-4664-86ed-7ab5d07c1e56": {"text": "r in the original application, or as modified in\nan amendment, or as approved by FTA in a budget revision), provided it does not alter the scope of work of the Award.\ne) The federal assistance source is the same and is transferred between ALIs, within each Project or across the Projects with different federal matching ratios.  For example, moving federal assistance from a capital activity with a match ratio of 80/20 to an operating activity with a match ratio of 50/50 requires a revision to the Award Budget.  Certain revisions may require a financial purpose code (FPC) transfer (e.g., prior TEAM Grants and Cooperative Agreements that are migrated to TrAMS).\nf) Changing the federal share of an existing ALI, such as changing an ALI from 80/20 to 85/15 to account for compliance with ADA or CAA requirements.\ng) The addition of an ALI to an existing scope of work approved for the Award, provided that the request does not change the source or amount of federal assistance originally awarded or change the scope of work of the Award and its Projects.\nAny change within an approved scope of work requires that the recipient affirm in its request for a revision to an Award Budget that the new activity is consistent with the approved TIP (if applicable) and STIP; and, if applicable, has satisfied NEPA requirements.  For example, if a construction management ALI was included for third-party contractors, but now a portion of the funds will be used for force account construction management, the intended scope of work remains the same.  If the addition of an activity included a scope of work to install/construct bus shelters, but the applicant desired to use a portion of the awarded funds now for the design of the bus shelters, a revision to the Award Budget could be used to add that new related activity since it leads to the completion of the approved scope of work.\nh) An Award under a competitive program has certain limitations and requirements when considering changes to the Award Budget.  Therefore, before proceeding with any changes (Revision to an Award Budget or Amendment to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement), the recipient should notify its FTA point of contact first for direction.\n(3) Financial Purpose Code (FPC) Transfers.  When a revision to the Award Budget includes a transfer of federal assistance between capital/operating/planning activities, FTA must concur (approve) in the change in the electronic award management system before the recipient is able to draw down federal assistance for the changed purpose.  The recipient should understand that a change in a FPC may result in a change to the overall non-federal share depending on the required matching ratios.  This is only applicable to federal assistance previously awarded under TEAM.\n(4) Period of Performance: Any changes to the Period of Performance, meaning the beginning or end date of the Award, may be made through a budget revision or an amendment with prior FTA approval.  No new expenditures should be made beyond the end date of an Award.  The recipient should consult the FTA Regional Office to determine if the change to the Award end date will be made through a budget revision or an amendment.\n(5) Rolling Stock Changes: A recipient must continue to meet FTA\u2019s rolling stock spare ratio requirements for any change in the number of revenue rolling stock.      If the change in the number of the approved Award impacts its spare ratios, the recipient must validate the change in its Rolling Stock Status Report.  FTA prior approval is required for Fixed Guideway Capital Investment Program projects \u2013 New and Small Starts and Core Capacity Improvements (Section 5309).  Section 5309 recipients should consult with the FTA Regional Office.\nb. Administrative Amendments to Awards.  An Administrative Amendment is initiated by FTA and may only be used when there is no change to the scope of work, amount or purpose of the Award.\nAn Administrative Amendment may be used for the following reasons:\n(1) To change or clarify the terms, conditions, or provisions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement; or\n(2) To change the fiscal year or type of federal assistance obligated for the Award; or\n(3) To deobligate federal assistance that is no longer needed to complete the approved project scope of work or purpose, without closing the Award.\nc. Amendments to Awards.   (1) General.  A new amendment to a Grant or Cooperative Agreement must meet the same application requirements as a request for a new Award.  Each Amendment is subject to DOL certification to the extent required by law.\nA new amendment to an Award made previously under TEAM and migrated into TrAMS, is restricted and must be coordinated with your regional office prior to incurring costs and initiating the Amendment.\nFTA requires an Amendment to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement if the request changes the scope of work of the Award.  For example, the applicant need not resubmit environmental documentation for activities approved under the original Award or prior approved amendment.  However, if the amendment includes new activities, requisite documentation should be provided; such as, environmental reviews and TIP/STIP information.\n(2) An Amendment to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  An Amendment to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement is required when there is either a change in the scope of work or addition of federal assistance to an existing Award (regardless if the source of assistance is the same or different).  Amendments will be required when the Award includes multiple sources of financial assistance and the action requires the addition of a new Scope Code to a Project.\nA new amendment to a Grant or Cooperative Agreement must meet the same application requirements as a request for a new Award.  Each Amendment is subject to DOL certification to the extent required by law.\n(3) Procedure.  All amendments must be submitted electronically through TrAMS.  Amendments to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement require a revised Grant or Cooperative Agreement and revised Award Budget, and may require additional milestones adjusting the schedule of one or more Projects therein, or a change in the amount or program/source(s) of federal assistance obligated for the Award.  The Amendment must meet the same requirements as a request for a new Award except that the recipient need not resubmit portions of the application for its original Award that are unaffected by the change.\nThe Recipient must describe the reason for the Amendment and the changes to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement, include a detailed description of each change and a revised Award Budget, and update the period of performance, if applicable (this may also require additional milestones).  To delineate the Amendment, the recipient should include a header (e.g., \u201cAmendment #1,\u201d) in each narrative section, including the Executive Summary, the Project narrative and the extended details of the associated ALI.\nFTA requires an Amendment to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement if the request changes the scope of work of the Award.  Amendments to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement include (Note: this list is not exhaustive):\na) A change in the project location, NEPA determination, or in the quantity of items to be purchased or constructed that substantially changes the purpose or intent of the Award.\nb) The addition of a new Project to the Award, or the division of an existing Project into multiple Projects, or deletion of a Project included in the Award.\nc) The addition or deletion of a Scope Code to an existing Project.\nd) The addition of an ALI to an existing Scope Code when it adds new independent scope of work to the Project, meaning, it is not associated with/or support other existing activities included in the Award.\ne) Change to Period of Performance, meaning, the beginning and end date of the Award.  The Period of Performance may be modified by amending the Award or by submitting an Award budget revision.  The recipient should consult the\nFTA Regional Office to determine if the change to the Period of Performance will be made through a budget revision or an amendment. No new expenditures should be made beyond the completion date of an Award.\nf) The request will increase or decrease the total amount of the federal funding of the Award.\ng) The federal program authorizing the Award is substituted (deobligate/reobligate), even if the total amount remains the same.\nh) The action will add a second program of federal assistance to the Award, even if the total federal Award amount remains the same.\n(4) Deobligation.  A change in federal assistance may occur when a recipient elects to deobligate one source of federal assistance and apply a different source; this may be part of the amount or the whole amount.\nIf the scope of work is unchanged and the only action is the deobligation of federal assistance, an Administrative Amendment may be used to process the modification to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  See Chapter III, subsection 4.b, \u201cAdministrative Amendment,\u201d above.\n(5) Change to Discretionary Awards or Earmarks.  A change to an Award resulting from a congressional earmark or a competitively selected discretionary program, must be consistent with the original intent of the congressional language authorizing the Award or activities included in the original discretionary application as outlined in the applicable Notice of Award.  For example, if the congressional earmark is only for a facility, an Amendment cannot add a scope of work for vehicles without explicit direction from Congress to FTA to change the earmark.  Likewise, discretionary Awards require concurrence from the FTA Headquarters and/or Office of the Secretary.  Before initiating an Amendment, contact your FTA regional or metropolitan office for assistance in making this determination.\n(6) Transfer of Assets from One Transit Property to Another Transit Property.  Any transfer of an asset that has an acti", "doc_id": "61c1846b-0a19-4664-86ed-7ab5d07c1e56", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "bacd035c-1747-4364-8736-40a436e99a0b": {"text": "ve federal interest (procured under an FTA Award), must be documented to demonstrate acceptance and the responsibility for continuing control of that asset over its useful life.  Since FTA retains an interest in that asset, the recipient agency must document the transfer in a new Award or an Amendment.  The balance of useful life should be referenced, and if the asset is rolling stock, an update to its fleet information in TrAMS and its fleet management/status plan is required.  An Amendment is not required if the asset is transferred after its useful life as defined in the original Award used for the purchase of the asset, or if the Award is not active or closed.  In this case, the recipient of the asset should document the transfer of the federally funded asset and attach the document to the recipient\u2019s profile in TrAMS.  If the recipient is not a current federal recipient, contact your FTA regional or metropolitan office for assistance.  At a minimum, in this situation, an agreement is needed between the\ntwo entities to document acceptance of the transfer of that asset and the continued compliance with the federal requirements that are bound to those assets.  A copy of that document must be transmitted to the FTA Regional or Metropolitan office.\n5. AWARD CLOSEOUT.  Closeout, in general, is the term used to signify the process by which the recipient and FTA agree that all activities approved for the Award have been completed and/or the federal assistance awarded has been expended for eligible costs.  Recipients are required to close an Award 90 days after the end of the period of performance.  FTA, or the recipient, may initiate the closeout process.  Closeout, by either party, does not preclude FTA\u2019s ability to seek repayment or other remedies for a recipient\u2019s breach of the terms and conditions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.   a. Closeout by Recipient.  The recipient is responsible to initiate closeout of the Award, within 90 days after the end of the period of performance, or after all approved activities are completed and/or the applicable federal assistance has been expended for all eligible costs.  Any deviation from the approved Award must be documented in the closeout amendment.  The recipient must initiate the closeout electronically, by submitting the following information in TrAMS, as part of the closeout process:  (1) Confirmation that activities are complete and if closeout Amendment will deobligate any unexpended balance of federal assistance;\n(2) A list of property acquired or improved in support of the Award that will continue to be within the purview of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement;\n(3) A final, reconciled Award Budget reflecting actual Project costs by scope code and activity, reflecting adjustments to the federal and non-federal amounts;\n(4) A final FFR, consistent with the reconciled Award Budget (e.g., deobligation);\n(5) A final narrative MPR indicating the actual completion date of each ALI and a discussion of each ALI contained in the final Award Budget; and\n(6) Any other documentation or reports required as part of the terms and conditions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.\nb. Closeout by FTA.  FTA may unilaterally initiate closeout of the Award.  FTA will contact the recipient, in writing, of its decision to initiate closeout of the Award with the appropriate reasoning included.  Circumstances that could cause FTA to close the Award at any time, include (Note: This list is not exhaustive):  (1) The recipient\u2019s failure to comply with the terms or conditions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement or other federal requirements;\n(2) Continuation of the Award would not produce results commensurate with further expenditure of funds;\n(3) Federal assistance is no longer needed to accomplish the purpose of the Award;\n(4) Failure by the recipient to make reasonable progress to complete activities under the Award for which federal assistance was awarded;\n(5) Failure by the recipient to execute the Award agreement within 90 days of FTA\u2019s Award; or\n(6) FTA\u2019s determination that the project has been essentially completed and the federal assistance awarded has been substantially drawn down.\nc. Adjustments to the Federal Share of Costs.  Necessary adjustments to the federal share of the costs of the Award are made after FTA receives and reviews the required closeout information.  Adjustments may also be necessary after the \u201cSingle Audit\u201d required by 2 CFR part 200 is performed.  Additional information pertaining to the required audit is contained in Chapter VI, \u201cFinancial Management.\u201d  Any federal assistance for the Award received by the recipient but not expended must be returned to FTA.  For more information pertaining to returning federal assistance to FTA, see Chapter VI, \u201cFinancial Management.\u201d\n6. SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION.   a. Suspension.  The suspension of the Award is an action by FTA that temporarily suspends federal assistance for the Award or a specific Project approved for the Award (or more than one Award) pending corrective action by the recipient or pending FTA\u2019s decision to terminate the Award.  If FTA determines that the recipient has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement, including the civil rights requirements, FTA will notify the recipient in writing of its intent to suspend the Award.  FTA may withhold further payments and/or prohibit the recipient from incurring additional obligations pending corrective action by the recipient or a decision to terminate for cause.  This includes work being performed by third-party contractors or consultants.  Unless FTA notifies the recipient otherwise, suspension will not invalidate obligations properly incurred by the recipient before the date of suspension to the extent that those obligations cannot be cancelled.\nb. Termination for Cause.  FTA may terminate the Award, in whole or in part, at any time before completion, whenever it determines that the recipient failed to comply with its conditions including failure to make reasonable progress.  FTA also may terminate the Award when FTA determines that continuing to provide federal assistance to support the Award does not adequately serve the purposes of the law authorizing that Award.  FTA will promptly notify the recipient in writing of its intent to terminate, the reasons therefor, and the effective date of termination.  Payments made to the recipient or recoveries by FTA will be made in accordance with the terms of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement and the legal rights and liabilities of both parties as specified in the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.\nc. Termination for Convenience.  FTA or the recipient may terminate the Award in whole or in part, when both parties agree that continuation of the Award would not produce results commensurate with the further expenditure of federal assistance.  By executing the Award, the recipient agrees at the outset to a termination for convenience in the event FTA makes such a finding.  Both parties must agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portions of the Award to be terminated.  The recipient may not incur new obligations for the terminated portion of the Award after the effective date of the termination and must cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible.  FTA evaluates each obligation to determine its eligibility for inclusion in the costs of the Award.  Settlement is made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  FTA allows full credit to the recipient for the federal share of the obligations (that cannot be cancelled) properly incurred by the recipient before termination.\nd. Partial Termination.  In some cases, FTA may deobligate federal assistance for the Award before closeout because the federal assistance is no longer needed to accomplish the purpose of the Award.\n7. RETENTION AND ACCESS REQUIREMENTS FOR RECORDS.   a. Applicability.  This section applies to all financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and other records of each recipient.  Records retention and access requirements also apply to the recipient\u2019s third-party contractors, third-party subcontractors, and subrecipients.  The recipients must include this requirement in third-party contracts, direct each subrecipient to include these requirements in their subagreements, and also direct its third-party contractors to include these requirements in its third-party subcontracts.  These records are:  (1) Records required to be maintained as identified in this circular; or as outlined in the terms of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement, or otherwise considered pertinent to FTA program requirements.\n(2) Records executed electronically, that may be retained electronically.  However, copies made by microfilming, photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original records, and files must be accessible for possible review, audit, or downloading to paper copy when required.\nb. Length of Retention Period.   (1) Except as otherwise specified, records must be retained for three years from the specific start dates specified in Chapter III, subsection 7.c, below.\n(2) To avoid duplicate record keeping, FTA may make special arrangements with the recipient (including subrecipients, as appropriate) to retain any records that are continually needed for joint use.  FTA will request the transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the records possess long-term retention value.  When the records are transferred to or maintained by FTA, the three-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.\nc. Starting Date of the Retention Period.   (1) General.  In most circumstances, the starting date for retention of records is the date when the recipient submits the final expenditure report to FTA.  For a project that is supported with federal assista", "doc_id": "bacd035c-1747-4364-8736-40a436e99a0b", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "e6ff43de-3bae-4a90-be53-8af871f73a89": {"text": "nce across multiple Awards, FTA may request that the starting date for retention of records be the date when the last associated Award is closed.  For example, for a large capital project where a third-party contract is funded across more than one Award, retention of records associated with that third-party contract would commence as soon as the last Award financing that third-party contract is closed.  If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, or other action involving the records has been started before the expiration of the three-year period, the records must be retained for three years after completion of the action and resolution of all issues that arise from it.\n(2) Equipment Records.  The three-year retention period for equipment records starts from the date of the equipment\u2019s disposition, replacement, or transfer at FTA\u2019s direction.\n(3) Records for Income Transactions after Closeout of the Award.  In some cases, the recipient must report income after the Award is closed.  When there is such a requirement, the retention period for the records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of the recipient\u2019s FY in which the income is earned, even if it falls after the date of the closeout of the Award (for example, if closeout occurs on September 5, and the recipient\u2019s FY ends on June 30 of the following year, record retention begins the next day, on July 1).\n(4) Indirect Cost Rate Proposals, Cost Allocation Plans (CAPs) and Similar Rate, and Rate Allocation Methods (including de minimis rate).  This paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals (including de minimis rates), CAPs, and any similar accounting computations or the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage charge back rates or composite fringe benefit rates).   a) If submitted for negotiation.  If the proposal, plan, or other computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the recipient) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the three-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of such submission.\nb) If not submitted for negotiation.  If the proposal, plan, or other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the recipient) for negotiation purposes, then the three-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or computation and its supporting records starts from the end of the FY (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.\n(5) Third-party Contract Records.  The retention period for all third-party contract records required to be retained commences after the recipient(s) makes final payment(s), and all other pending contract matters are closed.   a) Substitution of Photocopies.  Copies of documents may be substituted for the originals.\nb) Access to Records.   1 Records of Recipients and Subrecipients.  FTA, the U.S. DOT Office of Inspector General, and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives, have the right of access to any of the recipient\u2019s books, documents, papers, or other records that pertain to the Award, in order to perform audits, or make examinations, excerpts, or transcripts.\n2 Expiration of Right of Access.  The right of access in this section is not limited to the required retention period but continues as long as the records are retained.\nc) Restrictions on Public Access.  In general, the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, does not apply to any recipient record owned and possessed by the recipient until the recipient provides that record to the Federal Government.  Unless required by state or local law, recipients and subrecipients are not required to provide periodic public access to their records.  However, FTA may request a recipient to provide access to those records the recipient maintains on behalf of FTA, (i.e., records required by federal statute or regulation, such as Davis-Bacon wage records), or other records necessary to determine compliance with federal requirements established as conditions of eligibility for recipients of federal assistance.\nMANAGEMENT OF THE AWARD\n1. GENERAL.  Real property including facilities purchased or constructed under the Award, equipment including rolling stock, and supplies must be managed, used, and disposed of in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  This chapter provides guidance on the acquisition, management, use, and disposition of Federal Transit Administration (FTA) assisted property including facilities purchased or constructed under the Award, equipment including rolling stock, and supplies in accordance with 2 CFR part 200 and other federal requirements.\n2. REAL PROPERTY.  Real property must be acquired, in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (Uniform Act or URA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4601 et seq., and 49 CFR part 24, the implementing regulation.  Real property must be used and managed in accordance with the current Master Agreement and subpart D of 2 CFR part 200, specifically \u00a7\u00a7 200.311, 200.316, 200.329, 200.436, and 200.439.  The following requirements govern the acquisition, use, or disposition of real property purchased with federal assistance.  All regulatory references in this section are to 49 CFR part 24, unless specified otherwise. a. General.  If a recipient is using FTA funding, including local share funds, to acquire real property or provide relocation assistance necessary to secure property for the Award, the recipient must comply with the requirements in the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (Uniform Act or URA), as amended.  The Uniform Act is implemented by regulation, 49 CFR part 24.\nThe objective of the Uniform Act is to ensure equitable treatment of property owners of real property to be acquired under the federally-assisted Award; that people displaced by a federally assisted Award be treated fairly, consistently, and equitably; and that acquiring agencies implement the regulations in a manner that is efficient and cost effective.  The regulations implementing the Uniform Act are very specific in naming the means to achieve those legislated objectives.\nFTA must review and concur in appraisals and review appraisals for acquisitions and dispositions of more than $1,000,000 or in-kind contributions and land exchanges of any value before federal assistance is expended, or the value is used as non-federal share.  A review appraiser\u2019s report is required on all appraisals receiving federal assistance.  Federal assistance may be awarded before the appraisal is completed; however, the amount of the in-kind contribution cannot be determined and applied to the Award until the appraisal has been approved by FTA.  The requirements and processes for conducting appraisals, review appraisals, providing relocation assistance, and requesting FTA\u2019s concurrence are described as follows:\n(1) Unless otherwise agreed to by FTA in writing, to ensure eligibility for federal assistance, the recipient should follow the typical process sequence when acquiring real property under an Award.\nRecipients should not purchase property (or make a binding offer to purchase it) before completing NEPA, unless the provisions under 771.113(d) or FTA\u2019s Corridor Preservation guidance apply.\nHowever, recipients may engage in preliminary activities to complete the NEPA process provided they do not limit future NEPA considerations or violate the requirements of the Uniform Act.  These preliminary activities may include relocation planning and preliminary discussions with property owners that do not result in binding agreements.  If a recipient chooses to engage in any preliminary negotiations, its staff should prepare a statement for the owner\u2019s signature indicating that the owner understands these discussions to be preliminary and non-binding as to price and other consideration.  Failure to comply with this requirement may jeopardize the eligibility of the Award.\n(2) If a Recipient is considering leasing real property and facilities, discussed in this paragraph, or equipment (except for rolling stock or related equipment), discussed in subsection 4.l of this Chapter, rather than outright purchase of the same, and such lease is a capital not an operating lease, then the recipient must comply with 49 CFR part 639 \u201cCapital Leases\u201d except for provisions pertaining to cost effectiveness.\nb. Appraisal of Real Estate. (1) General.  An offer of just compensation must be established on the basis of recent independently prepared appraisal documents that estimate the fair market value.\n(2) Appraisers.  Appraisers must be certified or licensed with a State Appraisal Board as required by 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103(d)(2).  However, staff employees may be exempt from this requirement.  FTA recommends that appraisals and review appraisals be completed by appraisers experienced with state and federal laws for valuing properties for public acquisitions under the threat of eminent domain.  Appraisers and recipients making appraisal assignments should be familiar with the implementing regulations of the Uniform Act, 49 CFR part 24, especially subpart B\u2014Real Property Acquisition.  State subrecipients may use the state\u2019s staff appraisers to prepare required independent appraisals and appraisal reviews.\n(3) Requirements.  Appraisals must be fully compliant with all of the appraisal requirements as cited in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103(a).  This includes compliance with the Scope of Work (SOW) (reference Appendix D to this Circular), i.e., defining the appraisal requirements and, as appropriate, a realty/personalty report.  The appraisal SOW sets out the specifications for the appraisal of a specific parcel or grouping thereof.  It can be included in or appended to the contract wit", "doc_id": "e6ff43de-3bae-4a90-be53-8af871f73a89", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "3f47a359-21e2-4d1c-a51a-66e28aa440f2": {"text": "h a fee appraiser or the assignment to an agency staff appraiser.  The appraiser will also\nappropriately address the requirements of 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103(b) and (c) in the report concerning the effects of influence of the Award and owner retention of improvements.\nDepending on the individual State Appraisal Board, certified/licensed appraisers may need to utilize the jurisdictional exception provisions of Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) in order to complete the assignment for a public agency in full compliance with the requirements of 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103.\nIf the acquisition leaves the owner with an uneconomic remnant, the appraiser or review appraiser may be assigned the responsibility to make this determination and appraise the fair market value of the remnant.  See 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(k).\nThe owner also has a right to accompany the appraiser during the inspection of the property pursuant to 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(c)(1).\nWhen valuing properties that contain contamination or hazardous material, the appraiser must consider the effect, if any, the contamination\u2019s or material\u2019s presence has on the market value.  Recipients shall ensure that all Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) research results undertaken during the NEPA process are provided to the appraiser at the start of the valuation process.\nThe appraisal of property with contamination is a complex subject and is more fully covered in the discussion of the appraisal Scope of Work found in Appendix D.  Recipients should update appraisals over six months old in an active real estate market before fair market value is determined and submit to the FTA regional or Metropolitan office for review and concurrence, when required.  If the documents are not updated, the letter of transmittal to FTA shall provide adequate justification explaining why the appraisal was not updated.\n(4) Exceptions.  Full appraisal and/or negotiation procedures are not necessary in certain instances.  While an appraisal of the property may not be required in some of the following instances, the recipient must have some reasonable basis for its determination of fair market value in accordance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.101(b) and the related requirements to this section in 49 CFR part 24, Appendix A.  In the case of a donation, an appraisal may not be required; however, an appraisal is required if the recipient proposes to use the property as an in-kind contribution as part of the non-federal share.  State subrecipients may use the state\u2019s staff appraisers to prepare required independent appraisals.  FTA should be contacted for further guidance when any one of the following situations occurs: a) The owner is donating the property, reference 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 24.108 and 24.102(c)(2);\nb) The recipient does not have authority to acquire property by eminent domain as set out in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.101(b);\nc) The property qualifies as a voluntary acquisition as described in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.101(b); or\nd) The valuation is uncomplicated, and the fair market value is estimated at $10,000 or less, based on a review of available data, using the waiver valuation provision found at 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 24.102(c)(2) and 24.2(a)(33).\n(5) Exceptional Circumstances.  Recipients may request FTA review and approval to use other reasonable valuation methods for determining the remaining property valuation and federal interest at the time of the disposition request.  Other valuation methods could include accelerated depreciation, comparable sales, or established market values.  In its review of such a request, FTA may consider any action taken, omission made, or unfortunate occurrence the recipient suffered.\nc. Appraisal Review of Real Estate. (1) General.  All appraisals for acquisition of real property are to be reviewed in accordance with the Uniform Act and 49 CFR \u00a7 24.104.  The review appraisal should determine the soundness of the report\u2019s value estimate.  A qualified review appraiser (See 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103(d)(1), 49 CFR part 24, Appendix A, and 49 CFR \u00a7 24.104) shall examine the presentation and analysis of market information in all appraisals to assure that they meet the definition of an appraisal found in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.2(a)(3), as well as other appraisal requirements found in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103 and other applicable state and local requirements.  FTA requires that the review appraiser\u2019s comments be in a narrative format.  The review appraiser may use an appraisal checklist provided that it is supported by a narrative explanation of the key points of the appraisal.\nThe review appraiser is often expected to determine whether the value conclusion is consistent with state laws pertaining to what is compensable in eminent domain for public acquisitions and with the Uniform Act.  The review appraiser is also responsible for assuring that value estimates are consistent when multiple parcels of property are needed for the Award.  The review appraiser cannot determine the soundness of a report\u2019s value estimate without possessing familiarity with the subject property, the comparable sales used, and other market factors; thus rarely will only a desk review be sufficient.  The appraisal review report is expected to be a technical analysis of the appraisal, not merely an administrative review.\n(2) Requirements.  In accordance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.104(a), the review appraiser shall prepare a written report identifying each appraisal report as: a) Recommended (as the basis for the establishment of the amount believed to be just compensation);\nb) Accepted (meets all requirements, but not selected as recommended or approved); or\nc) Not accepted.\n(3) Establishment of Just Compensation.  If authorized by the recipient, a staff review appraiser may also establish the approved appraisal amount as the offer of just compensation.  Under no circumstances can the establishment of the just compensation amount be delegated to a contractor (i.e., a fee review appraiser) who is not a governmental official of the agency.\nIf the review appraiser is unable to recommend (or approve) an appraisal as an adequate basis for the establishment of the offer of just compensation, and it is determined by the acquiring agency that it is not practical to obtain an additional appraisal, the review appraiser may, as part of the review, present and analyze market information in conformance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103 to support a recommended (or approved) value (See 49 CFR part 24, Appendix A, related to 49 CFR \u00a7 24.104(b)).\nReview appraisers who are not staff employees must be state certified appraisers.\nd. Appraisal Concurrence Requirement.\nFTA concurrence is required for both appraisals and the appraisal reviews when:\n(1) For intended parcel acquisition and disposition, the valuation is greater than $1,000,000;\n(2) For non-federal contribution, whether in cash or in-kind contributions, and land exchange of any value; or\n(3) For property condemnations exceeding $1,000,000.\nNote: All appraisals regardless of value must be compliant with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.103.  FTA may choose to review any appraisal or review appraisal used in an FTA assisted Award when circumstances warrant or as part of a periodic review.  The recipient must maintain documentation that supports valuation decisions in the parcel files.\ne. Acquisition of Real Estate and Concurrence Requirements.  In accordance with URA requirements every effort should be made to acquire real property by negotiation based on the approved just compensation amount that has been determined by the acquiring agency and considering the requirements described below: (1) Market Value.  Before making an offer to the property owner, the recipient must first establish market value of the parcel to be purchased.  Property acquisition activities will be conducted in compliance with the requirements of 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 24.101 and 24.102.  Market value is to be established through a current appraisal and appraisal review accomplished in accordance with the requirements of 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 24.103 and 24.104, respectively.  Once the appraisal and the appraisal review are complete, a determination of just compensation must be made by the recipient in accordance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(d).\n(2) Making an Offer.  After the just compensation determination has been made by the agency, with FTA concurrence, if required, an offer can be made to the owner.\nNo owner shall be required to surrender possession of real property without either payment of the agreed purchase price to the owner or deposit of the established just compensation amount in a condemnation court as set out in 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(j).  The full amount of the deposit must be made available to the owner without prejudice pending the ultimate determination of just compensation by the judicial process.  The recipient must expeditiously reimburse property owners for actual, reasonable, and necessary expenses incidental to transfer of title pursuant to 49 CFR \u00a7 24.106.\n(3) Uneconomic remnant.  If the acquisition leaves the owner with an uneconomic remnant, the recipient must offer to acquire that remnant, and its value will be presented as an element of the written offer that is made (See 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(k)).\n(4) Filing Condemnation.  Additionally, FTA concurrence is required before filing for condemnation, if the appraised amount exceeds $1,000,000.\n(5) Administrative Settlements.  Any settlement in excess of the recipient\u2019s approved just compensation must be addressed as an administrative settlement (See definition, Chapter I, subsection 5.c. of this Circular) and 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(i).  The term \u201cadministrative settlements\u201d encompasses both negotiated settlements and legal settlements.  Legal settlements are those arrived at prior to a trial on the merits. a) Requirements.  Administrative settlements in excess of $50,000 of the current fair market value require prior FTA concurrence.  Note that relocation payments are not considered part of an administrative settlement.  Instead of using its power of eminent domain when a property cannot", "doc_id": "3f47a359-21e2-4d1c-a51a-66e28aa440f2", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "c153304d-b65c-4b87-90da-5a76a6642101": {"text": " be purchased at appraised value, a recipient may propose acquisition through negotiated settlement, as explained previously in Chapter IV, paragraph 2.e.(5) of this Circular.  The recipient must document that reasonable efforts to purchase the property at the appraised amount have failed and prepare a written justification supporting why the settlement is reasonable, prudent, and in the public interest.  Such a settlement will be handled in accordance with administrative settlement requirements at 49 CFR \u00a7 24.102(i).  If the settlement request represents a significant increase in excess of $50,000 of the just compensation and if trial risks are a key factor in the settlement justification, a litigation attorney for the recipient must be consulted and provide a signed letter of concurrence in the settlement.  The decision to recommend a settlement should evaluate among other relevant matters, the risks of settling for the proposed amount versus the risks of conducting a condemnation trial in court.\nb) Settlement Concurrence Requirement.  All settlements must be justified in writing and be available in the files pertaining to the Award.  The justification\nshall be thorough, document the entire settlement process, demonstrate the logic and reason supporting the settlement, and be able to withstand the scrutiny of an independent review.  If either type of settlement exceeds FTA\u2019s threshold for approval, it must be submitted to FTA for advance concurrence before the settlement is consummated.\nf. Relocation Assistance.  The relocation assistance program provides a variety of advisory services and benefits to displaced people, businesses, and nonprofit organizations.  The highlights of this program element and FTA policies related to it are summarized in the following: (1) Early provision of written notices and explanations of federal acquisition and relocation programs must be provided to displacees as required by 49 CFR part 24.\n(2) No lawful occupant will be required to move without at least 90 days\u2019 advance notice per 49 CFR \u00a7 24.203(c).\n(3) In the case of residential displacees, at least one comparable replacement dwelling must be made available before the displacees must move.  Rental assistance and replacement housing payments are provided to make the dwellings affordable and available at the time the notice is given.  See 49 CFR \u00a7 24.204.\n(4) All displacees, both business and residential, are reimbursed for certain moving expenses per 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 24.301 through 24.306.\n(5) There must be as many residential dwellings available as there are families who will be displaced.  The dwellings must be comparable to the ones from which the people are displaced.  In addition, the comparable replacement dwellings must be decent, safe, and sanitary (DSS); located in the same area or in areas generally not less desirable in regard to public utilities and public and commercial facilities; reasonably accessible to the displacees\u2019 places of employment and within the financial means of the displaced families; and adequate in size to accommodate the occupants in accordance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.204. a) The definition of DSS at 49 CFR \u00a7 24.2(a)(8) contains the following requirements regarding the number of rooms and area of living space for the displacees.  \u201cThe number of persons occupying each habitable room used for sleeping purposes shall not exceed that permitted by local housing codes or, in the absence of local codes, the policies of the displacing Agency.  In addition, the displacing Agency shall follow the requirements for separate bedrooms for children of the opposite gender included in local housing codes or in the absence of local codes, the policies of such agencies.\u201d\nb) In the absence of applicable housing codes, FTA\u2019s policy requires separate bedrooms and gender separation for children over 12 years of age.\n(6) Replacement housing must be open to all people regardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin as required by 49 CFR \u00a7 24.8 of the URA regulations.\n(7) Any relocation benefits required by state or local law exceeding the specified limits in the Uniform Act will not be reimbursed by FTA.\n(8) Any global type settlements of a property acquisition that involve the inclusion of relocation payments based on other than relocation costs that are actual, reasonable, and necessary are not eligible for FTA reimbursement in accordance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.207(e) of the URA regulations.\n(9) Rental and for-sale dwellings used in the determination of replacement housing benefits must be actually and currently available for sale or rent.  FTA does not allow the use of rent schedules for the calculation of rental housing cost differentials as it is not compliant with the URA regulations that require that comparable and currently available rental properties be identified and provided to the displacees.\ng. Special Real Estate Acquisition Program Strategies/Issues.  Several real estate program strategies or issues are worthy of discussion in some detail as follows: (1) Alternative Procedure.  A recipient with a qualified and fully staffed real estate department conducting a major capital project within an FTA assisted Award may request an alternative process, which permits higher dollar thresholds before FTA prior concurrence is needed.\nRecipients may request a review through the FTA Regional Office.  An FTA real estate specialist will review the acquisition process and the recipient\u2019s capabilities.\nThe request for the approval for alternative real property procedures at a minimum should include the following:\na) A statement providing an overall justification and reasoning for why the alternative procedure is requested;\nb) A copy of real estate department operating procedures;\nc) A real estate department organization staffing chart;\nd) A strategy for using and qualifying real estate services contractors, if used;\ne) An estimate of the number of transactions that may exceed requested threshold(s);\nf) A discussion of real estate acquisition schedule/status relative to the overall schedule for the Award; and\ng) A discussion of real estate department program quality assurance/quality control procedures that are in place to assure program delivery is in compliance with Uniform Act requirements and effective/efficient operational standards given the higher thresholds requested.\n(2) In-Kind Contributions.  Recipients may use in-kind contributions of real property as part of the non-federal share so long as the property to be donated is needed to carry out the scope of work of the Award.  Contributions of real property as non-federal share, either owned and contributed by the recipient or by a third party to the recipient, must meet the following criteria:  a) Are verifiable from the recipient\u2019s records;\nb) Are not included as contributions for any other Award;\nc) Are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of the objectives of the Award;\nd) Are allowable under the Federal Cost Principles;\ne) Are not paid for by the Federal Government under another federal Award; except where an applicable federal statute specifically allows such payment; and\nf) Are provided for in the Award Budget.\nThe property can be owned and donated by the recipient or by a third party.  The in-kind contribution allowance will be based on the current market value as independently appraised.  Appraisals and review appraisals for property being donated, regardless of appraised value, must be submitted to the FTA regional or metropolitan office for concurrence.  The value of the donated property may not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.\nCredit can only be allowed for the value of the portion of real property used or consumed by the project.  If part of a larger parcel is to be used as non-federal share and the remaining sub-parcel is intended to be used at a future date for future share, the recipient is cautioned to clearly indicate the limits of the sub-parcel to be used as non-federal share and the appraised amount associated with the sub-parcel.  The remnant sub-parcel can then follow the same procedure for future non-federal share.  If the entire parcel is provided as non-federal share and no delineation is made related to possible use of the excess sub-parcel as over-match, eligibility of the over-match sub-parcel may be lost.  If federal assistance were used to purchase the property, only the non-federal share of such property may be counted as the value of the in-kind contribution.\n(3) Land Exchanges.  Some recipients find that during the development of the Award, better uses of federally assisted property can be achieved by exchanging parts or parcels with neighboring property owners, sometimes called a land swap or land exchange.  FTA does not have a separate process for these transactions; instead, this action is accomplished through determining the current fair market value, by appraisal, of the property to be acquired and the property to be disposed by the recipient.  Since the land exchange process is in lieu of a typical acquisition, all of the Uniform Act requirements are applicable.  If the Award is still open, and the\npart to be disposed is more valuable than the part acquired, the net proceeds must be credited to the open Award.  If the Award is closed, or not yet developed, the recipient should follow other disposition methods defined in this chapter.\n(4) Joint Development.  Please refer to the most recent edition of FTA Circular 7050.1, \u201cFederal Transit Administration Guidance on Joint Development,\u201d for further information if seeking to pursue a joint development with federally assisted property.\n(5) Functional Replacement.  Functional replacement provides a method of paying the cost necessary to replace a publicly owned facility (i.e., a fire station or public school) being acquired with a similar needed facility.  The FTA regional or metropolitan office should be contacted for further information.\n", "doc_id": "c153304d-b65c-4b87-90da-5a76a6642101", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "0579bea4-b0ca-4834-ac10-41b94da910b5": {"text": "A determination to use functional replacement should be made early in the development process for the project(s) under the Award.  The use of this approach would usually be addressed during the environmental review phase preceding the Award and be presented as a mitigation measure to be undertaken under the Award.\n(6) Contaminated Property (including Brownfields as defined in Chapter 1 of this Circular).\nAs part of the NEPA process, the recipient must undertake appropriate due diligence to identify the risks associated with acquiring property that may be contaminated.  For all real estate acquisitions, the recipient must undertake a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) to assess the environmental condition of the property and identify actual or potential areas where contaminants may have been released to the environment.  If the results of the Phase I ESA indicate that the property is likely contaminated, the recipient shall undertake, as appropriate, additional Phase II and III ESAs to confirm the presence of contaminations and quantify the cost to remediate based on the intended use of the property for the federally assisted capital transit Award.  For those projects in which FTA issues a NEPA determination with detailed documentation, all necessary remediation commitments based on the results and recommendations of the ESA(s), including commitments to engage in further evaluations if the site access was restricted, will be included in FTA\u2019s NEPA determination.  For NEPA determinations without detailed documentation, any such remediation commitments must be included in the file for the Award and in the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  When acquiring contaminated properties, the recipient, as project sponsor, should collect as much information as possible regarding the levels of contamination on the desired site and determine an appropriate approach for remediation prior to the completion of NEPA.\nThe results of the Phase I, II, and III ESAs, where available, and other site-specific documentation prepared by the recipient must be provided to the real estate appraiser for consideration of the effect, if any, contamination has on the highest and best use (HBU) and the market value of the property, including what is\ncommonly referred to in many states as a market condition known as \u201cstigma,\u201d in accordance with state law.\nThe valuation analysis of a contaminated property involves a complex economic and environmental analysis from the standpoint of HBU that requires the careful preparation of an appraisal Scope of Work that appropriately addresses the appraisal problem as provided in Appendix D.  Due to the complexity of appraisals involving contaminated property, it is suggested you contact your FTA Regional Office for legal and technical assistance as early as possible.\nAn FTA environmental determination (FEIS/ROD, ROD, FONSI, or CE) should be obtained before any offer to purchase or other commitment is made to purchase the property or to proceed to a settlement.  Further, ESA Phases I, II, and III may be required including estimated remediation costs before a reliable real estate appraisal of the value of the property can be completed.  Such information may be required by the appraiser to determine the cost of any remediation required for the HBU or other uses, including the use anticipated for the capital transit Award.  It may be necessary to obtain a right of entry (ROE) or other preliminary property interest to do appropriate site assessments, if available.\nSince it may be difficult for a recipient to undertake a Phase II ESA prior to land acquisition since such a study is intrusive and requires access to the site and actual physical samples to be collected, the recipient shall consider the following limitations prior to acquiring contaminated properties:\na) The legal responsibility for hazardous material cleanup and disposal rests with parties within the property title chain and with parties responsible for the placement of the material on the property.  Recipients must attempt to identify and seek legal recourse from those potentially responsible parties or substantiate the basis for not seeking reimbursement for FTA review and consideration.\nb) The estimated cost to remediate the contamination may result in a total cost of the Award that exceeds the recipient\u2019s ability to fully finance it without significant risk to the project.  If the recipient and FTA determine that the recipient does not have sufficient funds to proceed with the Award, the recipient shall seek an alternate site for the Award.  Any FTA assistance provided to the recipient to purchase property that is subsequently abandoned shall be either returned to FTA or credited against a future property acquisition.\nc) FTA generally will not participate in the remediation of contamination discovered during construction, except where it has been demonstrated that appropriate environmental studies were performed, the results communicated to the appraiser prior to the appraisal, and the recommendations followed.\nThere are two exceptions to this policy as follows:\n1 The brownfield site was previously utilized for transportation use, and the recipient or transit agency is legally responsible for all cleanup activity; or\n2 Seeking and obtaining compensation from potentially responsible parties would involve excessive litigation and delay in completing the Award, the cost of which would likely exceed the remediation cost, and which would be contrary to the public interest.\nFTA also recognizes that the recipient may not be able to quantify the extent of contamination or cost to remediate the property until the recipient obtains access to the site to conduct a Phase II or possibly Phase III ESA.  In these instances, FTA will work with the recipient to develop a process for estimating the total cost of the Award, including cleanup, to ascertain whether or not the Award should continue as planned given the site conditions.  FTA will consider what assurances the recipient can provide to minimize the risks associated with developing a contaminated site prior to approving an Award for construction activities.  Where the risks are deemed too great for the Award to bear, FTA will instruct the recipient to locate an alternate site to support the Award.\nd) Refer to Appendix D, \u201cGuide for Preparing an Appraisal Scope of Work\u201d for a discussion of the valuation of contaminated property.\ne) The recipient should contact FTA for technical assistance regarding contaminated property.\nh. Real Estate Acquisition Management Plan (RAMP).  FTA requires a RAMP for each major capital project within an Award as a part of the Project Management Plan (PMP) under 49 CFR \u00a7 633.25 and the Relocation Plan in accordance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.205.  A RAMP is not required for other capital projects within an Award with real estate acquisition; however, all capital projects must be in compliance with 49 CFR \u00a7 24.205, if real estate acquisition or relocation assistance is involved.  The RAMP is a planning document for the acquiring agency and is a control document for FTA that includes real estate goals and methodology from the perspective of timing, staffing, statutory, and policy issues.\nThe RAMP should be periodically reviewed by the recipient for needed changes.  A written relocation plan should be a part of the RAMP if there are anticipated displacements of residential occupants or businesses.  The extent of the relocation plan should be commensurate with the complexity and volume of displacements.\nThe RAMP must clearly detail how the needed real estate for the Award will be acquired.  See Appendix C of this circular for a model in the development of a RAMP.\ni. Property Management.  This area concerns the post-construction management of property acquired for the facility during development to ensure that it is properly maintained and operated efficiently for the benefit of the transit system. (1) Title to Real Property is vested in the recipient or other public bodies.  The recipient agrees to include a covenant in the title of the real property acquired for use under the Award that assures non-discrimination during the useful life of the property.\n(2) Use.  Real property must be used for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose.  Recipients must not dispose of, modify the use of, or encumber its title or other interests in the federally assisted site and facilities without prior FTA written approval.  Recipients are required to use federally assisted property continuously and appropriately throughout the useful life of the property.  Recipients may be required to return the entire amount of federal assistance spent on the Award or federally assisted property thereunder if, during the useful life, the recipient has unreasonably delayed or failed to use the federally assisted property for its originally intended purpose.  Recipients are also required to notify FTA before property is removed from the service originally intended at the time of approval of the Award and if property is put to additional or substitute uses.\n(3) Maintenance.  Real property must be appropriately maintained.  A description of the improvements, expansions, retrofits, and maintenance of real property must be properly documented in the facility inventory along with parcel address or location, useful life, date placed in service, original acquisition cost and federal percentage of cost in order to accurately determine an equitable valuation of federal interest at the time of early disposition of the asset.\n(4) Idle Facilities and Idle Capacity.   a) Idle facility means completely unused facilities that are excess to the recipient\u2019s current needs.  Idle capacity means the unused capacity of partially used facilities.  Idle capacity is the difference between that which a facility could achieve under 100 percent operating time, on a one-shift basis, less operating interruptions resulting", "doc_id": "0579bea4-b0ca-4834-ac10-41b94da910b5", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "930f132b-c1e0-437d-b4bd-9230c684483d": {"text": " from time lost for repairs, setups, unsatisfactory materials, and other normal delays and the extent to which the facility was actually used to meet demands during the accounting period.\nb) Costs of Idle Facilities or Idle Capacity.  Cost of idle facilities or idle capacity means costs such as maintenance, repair, housing, rent, and other related costs including insurance and depreciation.  The costs of idle facilities are unallowable except to the extent that they are necessary to meet workload requirements which may fluctuate and are allocated appropriately to all programs or it can be shown that the costs were necessary when acquired and are now idle because of changes in program requirements, efforts to achieve more economical operations, reorganization, termination or other causes which could not have been reasonably foreseen.  Under the exception previously stated, costs of idle facilities are allowable for a reasonable period of time, ordinarily not to exceed one year, depending on the initiative taken to use, lease, or dispose of the facilities and the justification provided by the recipient for FTA review and approval.\n(5) Reporting on Real Property. Recipients must maintain adequate records on the status of real property in which the Federal Government retains an interest.  FTA requires that recipients maintain a real property inventory on file for review upon request by FTA to satisfy the requirements of 2 CFR \u00a7 200.329, which requires recipients to submit reports on an annual basis for real property in which the Federal Government retains an interest.  In instances where the federal interest in the real property will extend for a period of 15 years or more, a recipient may request FTA\u2019s permission to report at multi-year frequencies, not to exceed a five-year reporting period.\nA Real Property Inventory must include: property location/physical address; use and condition of the property; summary of conditions on the title; brief description of improvements, expansions, and retrofits; corresponding useful life for the assets; date placed in service; original acquisition cost; sources of funding; federal and non-federal participation ratios; federal award identification number; appraised value and date; anticipated disposition or action proposed; date of disposal; and sale price of the property.  If the property is excess, identify the reasons for having excess property, such as purchase to a logical boundary.  This inventory is necessary in order to accurately account for assets, and determine an equitable valuation of federal interest retained in the property.\nThe Excess Real Property Inventory and Utilization Plan requirement applies only to Grants or Cooperative Agreements awarded before December 26, 2014.\nThe Real Property Reporting requirement (Real Property Inventory) replaces the Excess Real Property Inventory and Utilization Plan requirement for Grants and Cooperative Agreements (and funding increments to existing Grants and Cooperative Agreements) awarded on or after December 26, 2014.\n(6) Non-Transit Uses of FTA Assisted Real Property.  FTA\u2019s policy is to permit recipients maximum flexibility in determining the best and most cost-effective use of federally-assisted property.  To this end, FTA encourages non-transit uses of real property that can raise additional revenues for the transit system or, at a reasonable cost, enhance system ridership.  These non-transit uses are by one of three means: incidental use, joint development, or shared use.   a) Incidental Use.  Incidental uses must be compatible with the approved purposes of the Award and may not interfere with either the intended uses of the property or the recipient\u2019s ability to maintain satisfactory continuing control.  The recipient should consult with FTA before continuing with incidental use.  An incidental use may not affect a property\u2019s transit capacity or use.  Alterations to accommodate an incidental use should have no negative impact on the transit service or activity.  FTA continues to monitor the incidental use after the Award is closed and the recipient is required to keep an inventory of the use.  FTA reviews the inventory during the triennial review process.   1 Examples of incidental use include:  a Temporary use of transit property as a staging area for nearby construction;\nb Allowing nearby theaters and restaurants to use transit parking spaces during the transit system\u2019s off-hours;\nc Leasing of space in a station for a newspaper stand or coffee shop when the additional use does not interfere with the original purpose authorized in the Award; and\nd The lease of air rights over transit facilities or utilities associated with transit facilities (such as spare capacity in general utilities and fiber optics communications utilities) that do not impact the structural configuration of the transit facility.\n2 Revocation.  An incidental use agreement should permit revocation by the recipient.\n3 Limits.  The recipient agrees that any incidental use of federally assisted property will not exceed that permitted under applicable federal requirements and federal guidance.  The recipient may permit non-transit public entities and private entities to have incidental use of its federally assisted facilities and equipment, including alternative fueling facilities and associated equipment, subject to the following considerations:  a Needed Property.  This policy applies only to property that continues to be needed and used for an FTA Award.  It is FTA\u2019s intention to assist only in the purchase of property that is needed for an FTA Award.\nb Purpose & Activity.  The use must not compromise the safe conduct of the intended purpose and activity of the initial public transit activity under the Award.\nc Continuing Control.  The use must not in any way interfere with the recipient\u2019s continuing control over the use of the property or the recipient\u2019s continued ability to carry out the Award.\nd No-Income Use.  While FTA is particularly interested in encouraging incidental use as a means of supplementing transit revenues, no-income uses are also permitted under certain circumstances,\nFor example, a no-income use could include a private, for-profit transit operator offered queue space, or loading space, at an intermodal facility for the purpose of generating rides, providing a\nconsolidated transit option for the public, and a seamless transit transfer opportunity at no cost.\nThe no-income use shows that the value of having the private operator:\n1) benefits transit, as a whole;\n2) expands upon the local transportation alternatives; and\n3) allows the public to transfer seamlessly.     e Income.  Proceeds from incidental use including licensing and leasing of air rights or leasing of other real property interest should be based on competitive market rents and rates of return based on the appraised fair market value.  Income received from the authorized incidental uses including the use of air rights may be retained by the recipients (without returning the federal share) if the income is used for eligible transit capital, or operating expenses.  This income cannot be used as part of the non-federal share of the Award from which it was derived.  However, it may be used as part of the non-federal share of another FTA Award.\nf Recapture.  The recipient should recapture all the costs related to the incidental use from the non-transit public entity or private entity, including all applicable excise taxes on fuel for fueling facilities and wear and tear to capital improvements, unless FTA approves otherwise.\nb) Joint Development.  A joint development project is a transit capital project that integrally relates to, and often co-locates with commercial, residential, mixed-use or other non-transit development within an Award.  Joint development may include partnerships for public or private development associated with any mode of the transit system that is being improved through new construction, renovation, or extension.  Joint development may also include intermodal facilities, intercity bus and rail facilities, transit malls, or historic transportation facilities.  A joint development project, awarded with FTA federal assistance, must satisfy the four eligibility criteria of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5302(3)(G).  See the most recent edition of FTA Circular 7050.1, \u201cGuidance on Joint Development\u201d for further information or guidance.\nc)  Shared Use.  Shared use takes place when a non-transit partner, separate from the recipient, occupies a part of a facility and pays its pro rata share of the construction, maintenance, and operation costs.  Shared uses must be declared at the time of Award.  Shared use of property requires prior written FTA approval except when it involves coordinated public transit human services transportation.  Shared use Awards should be clearly identified and sufficient detail provided to FTA at the time of review to determine allocable costs related to non-transit use for construction, as well as on-going\nmaintenance, and operation costs.  The shared use description of the Award and the definition of the partner participating in the Award must be clearly identified before approval of the Award.\nThe recipient must ensure satisfactory continuing control over the transit portion of the property.\nExamples of shared use projects under an Award include:\n1 A vehicle maintenance facility that services both transit rolling stock and non-transit vehicles;\n2 A parking garage that provides parking for transit rolling stock as well as parking for non-transit uses; and\n3 A parking garage that is constructed to provide parking for both transit patrons and the general public or for a specific business purpose.\nj. Real Estate Disposition. (1) Real Property Reporting Requirements, for Grants or Cooperative Agreements awarded after December 26, 2014.  The Recipient shall prepare and keep up to date the real property inventory for all property that is no longer needed ", "doc_id": "930f132b-c1e0-437d-b4bd-9230c684483d", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "4167a670-5023-4386-96d1-6ca4b9ffbe4f": {"text": "to carry out any transit purpose.  The inventory list should include such things as the property location, a summary of any conditions on the title, the original acquisition cost, the federal participation ratio, the federal Award identification number, the appraised value and date, a brief description of improvements, the current use of the property, and the anticipated disposition or action proposed.\nRecipients are also required to notify FTA when property is removed from the service originally intended when an Award is made and if property is put to additional or substitute uses.  The recipient\u2019s plan should identify and explain the reason for the excess property.  Such reasons may include one or more of the following:\na) The parcel, when purchased, exceeded the recipient\u2019s need (uneconomic remnant, purchased to logical boundary, part of administrative settlement, etc.);\nb) The property was purchased for construction staging purposes such as access, storage or underpinning, and construction is completed;\nc) The intended use of the parcel is no longer possible because of system changes, such as alignment, or amendments to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement for the Award;\nd) Improvements to real property were damaged or destroyed, and therefore the property is not being used for purposes of the Award, but it is still needed for\nthe Award.  If so, the improvements may be renovated or replaced.  In this case, applicable cost principles must be observed; and/or\ne) A portion of the parcel remains unused, will not be used for purposes of the Award in the foreseeable future, and can be sold or otherwise disposed.\nUnless FTA and the recipient agree otherwise, the real property inventory is to be retained by the recipient, available for review upon FTA request, and available for review during the triennial review process.\n(2) Disposition.  If the recipient determines that real property is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was acquired, FTA may approve the use of the property for other purposes.   a) Valuation of Property Pending Disposal.  For properties no longer needed for transit purposes, the recipient is expected to follow the valuation requirements of 49 CFR part 24 and obtain an appraisal and appraisal review to ascertain the value of the property considered for disposal.  Appraisals developed for disposition purposes are required to appraise the value of the land separate from the value of the improvements and these two values must be submitted in the report.  FTA\u2019s determination of the remaining federal interest in the federally assisted property, that have been removed from service before the end of the useful life of the improvements is determined by comparing the fair market value of the entire property with the value of the land plus the depreciated value of the improvements on the land and taking the greater of these two values as the remaining federal interest in the property.\nFTA recognizes that exceptional circumstances may require the recipient to utilize another method of valuation to determine the fair market value of real property that is withdrawn from service.  Under unusual circumstances, the recipient may request permission to use another reasonable valuation method including, but not limited to accelerated depreciation, comparable sales, or established market values.\nApproval of an exceptional circumstance will necessitate FTA consideration of the action the recipient took, any omission the recipient made, or any unfortunate occurrence the recipient suffered.\nFor those situations where the existing improvements do not contribute to the highest and best use of the site valuation, recipients should use an accounting approach to ascertain the remaining economic life and value of the improvements rather than an appraisal valuation approach.  Contact the FTA Regional or Metropolitan office for further information.\nb) Disposition Methods.  When real property is no longer needed for any transit purpose, the recipient will request disposition instructions from FTA.  The allowable disposition methods are as follows: 1 Sell and Reimburse FTA.  Competitively market and sell the property and pay FTA the greater of its share of the fair market value of the property or the straight line depreciated value of the improvements plus land value.  FTA\u2019s share of the fair market value is the percentage of FTA participation in the original Award multiplied by the best obtainable price, minus reasonable sales costs.  If the property has never been used for the appropriate purposes of the Award, the recipient shall sell the property and pay FTA the greater of FTA\u2019s share of the fair market value or the entire amount of federal assistance spent on that property.\n2 Offset.  Sell the property and apply the net proceeds from the sale to the cost of replacement property under the same program.  Return any excess proceeds to FTA in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.311.\n3 Sell and Use Proceeds for Other Capital Projects Under an Award.  Sell the property and use the proceeds to reduce the gross cost of another FTA eligible capital transit project under an Award.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(h)(4).  The recipient is expected to record the receipt of the proceeds in the recipient\u2019s accounting system, showing that the funds are restricted for use in a subsequent capital project, and reduce the amount of those restricted funds as those proceeds are applied to one or more FTA approved capital projects under Awards.  FTA must approve the application of the proceeds to a subsequent capital Award, which should clearly show that the gross cost of the Award has been reduced with proceeds from the earlier transaction.  Examples of future FTA eligible capital transit projects include: the acquisition of buses, facilities and equipment.\n4 Sell and Keep Proceeds in an Open Award.  If the Award is still open, the recipient may sell the excess property and apply the proceeds to the original cost of the total real property purchased for that Award.  This may reduce the federal share of the Award.\n5 Transfer to Public Agency for Non-Transit Use.  Follow procedures for publication in the Federal Register to transfer property (land or equipment) to a public agency with no repayment to FTA.  This is a competitive process, and there is no guarantee that a particular public agency will be awarded the excess property.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(h)(1)\u2013(h)(3).\n6 Transfer to Another Award.  Transfer the property to another FTA eligible Award.  The federal interest continues.\n7 Retain Title with Buyout.  Compensate FTA by computing the percentage of FTA participation in the original cost.  Multiply the current fair market value of the property by this percentage.  The recipient must document the basis for value determination; typically, this documentation is an\nappraisal or market survey.  Alternatively, the recipient may pay FTA the straight line depreciated value of improvements plus land value, if this is greater than FTA\u2019s share of the fair market value.\n8 Sales Procedure.  Sales procedures shall be followed that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return or at least payment of appraised fair market value.\n3. FTA MANAGEMENT AND PROJECT OVERSIGHT OF PROPERTY ACQUISITION.  FTA stewardship of an Award includes various strategies, and in some cases involves the application of risk management techniques.  Based on various conditions including dollar thresholds and the complexity of the property acquisitions involved, FTA may require the submission of all transactions meeting certain criteria for prior approval.  Refer to the discussion of prior concurrence for certain appraisal, condemnation, and settlement issues discussed in Chapter IV of this circular.\nFTA may also conduct a process or transactional review at any time during or after implementation of the real estate acquisition program to ensure compliance with the governing laws and regulations.\n4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES (INCLUDING ROLLING STOCK).  Management standards apply to equipment and supplies purchased with federal assistance.  The term \u201cfederally assisted property\u201d, as used in this section, includes equipment, including rolling stock, and supplies.  Rolling stock describes equipment that is used to transport passengers and includes buses, vans, cars, railcars, locomotives, trolley cars and buses, ferryboats, and vehicles used for guideways and incline planes.  Light duty vehicles, such as vans, sedans, and pick-up trucks, employed in administrative and maintenance purposes are considered equipment.  Light duty vehicles employed to transport passengers are considered rolling stock.  The following requirements are for the acquisition, use, management, and disposition of federally assisted property: a. State Recipients and Other Than State Recipients.   (1) The Uniform Guidance provides that a state will use, manage, and dispose of federally assisted property acquired under an Award by the state in accordance with state laws and procedures, 2 CFR \u00a7 200.313(b).  Subrecipients of states shall follow policies and procedures allowed by the state with respect to the use, management and disposal of federally assisted property, 2 CFR \u00a7 1201.313.\n(2) The Uniform Guidance also provides that recipients other than states must follow FTA requirements and procedures outlined below.\nb. Property Title.  Title to federally assisted property acquired under an Award is vested in the recipient.  The title must be a conditional title, subject to the following conditions: (1) Federally assisted property must be used for authorized purposes of the project during the useful life of the asset or until no longer needed for the purposes of the project;\n(2) The recipient must not encumber the property without prior approval from FTA or the pass-through entity; and\n(3) The property must be used and disposed of in accordance with the requirements located in this chapter, as", "doc_id": "4167a670-5023-4386-96d1-6ca4b9ffbe4f", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "4426e0ca-b76e-4570-a1dc-bd1c376df186": {"text": " well as 2 CFR \u00a7 200.313 for equipment (including rolling stock), and 2 CFR \u00a7 200.314 for supplies.\nc. Federal Interest.  FTA retains a federal interest in any federally assisted property financed with FTA assistance until, and to the extent that, FTA relinquishes its federal interest in that federally assisted property.  This applies to real property, equipment and supplies.\nd. Acquisition.  The acquisition cost of federally assisted property means the purchase price of the property acquired for this Award.  This is the net invoice unit price, including the cost of modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the federally assisted property usable for the intended purpose.  Other charges such as the cost of inspection, installation, transportation, taxes, duty, or protective in-transit insurance should be treated in accordance with the recipient\u2019s regular accounting practices as separate line items.  Recipients must follow the procurement procedures set forth in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 4220.1 to the extent it complies with federal laws and regulations.\nTwo areas of particular importance for rolling stock procurements are:\n(1) Buy America.  FTA may not obligate federal assistance for an Award unless the steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in the Award are produced in the Unites States, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5323(j).  When procuring rolling stock, the cost of components and subcomponents produced in the United States (i) for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, is more than 60 percent of the cost of all components of the rolling stock; (ii) for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, is more than 65 percent of the cost of all components of the rolling stock; and (iii) for fiscal year 2020 and each fiscal year thereafter, is more than 70 percent of the cost of all components of the rolling stock.  Additionally, final assembly of the rolling stock must occur in the United States.  FTA strongly advises recipients to review the FTA Buy America regulations, before undertaking any procurement.  See also FTA\u2019s Buy America Web site for further policy and decision documents.\n(2) Pre-Award and Post-Delivery Reviews for Rolling Stock.  FTA requires that recipients purchasing revenue passenger rolling stock undertake reviews of the rolling stock before award of the bid, during manufacture, and following delivery of the rolling stock.  Applicants seeking to acquire rolling stock must certify that they will comply with FTA\u2019s pre-award and post-delivery review requirements.\nThe requirement to undertake the pre-award and post-delivery reviews arises from 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5323(m) and is implemented by FTA regulations at 49 CFR part 663.  The reviews are intended to improve compliance with Buy America requirements, the recipient\u2019s bid specifications, and federal motor vehicle safety standards.  FTA has tried to carry out the intent of the law in a way that builds on current practices\nby many recipients and that improves the monitoring of compliance in the least burdensome manner.  Reviews may be conducted by the recipient\u2019s staff or by a contractor for the recipient.  The regulations require a resident inspector who is not an agent or an employee of the manufacturer to review for the recipient the manufacturer\u2019s compliance with the specification at the manufacturing site.  An inspection is not required when the procurement is for unmodified vans, 10 or fewer buses acquired by an operator serving an urbanized area with a population of more than 200,000 persons, or 20 or fewer buses acquired by an operator serving other than urbanized areas or urbanized areas with populations of 200,000 or fewer.  The recipient must keep on file and make available to FTA upon request written reports resulting from the reviews.  Compliance must be certified on the Annual List of Certifications and Assurances.  FTA has published a handbook to assist with conducting pre-award and post-delivery audits for bus and railcar procurements, which contains copies of all the required certifications to assist recipients in complying with this requirement.  A copy of this handbook can be found on FTA\u2019s Buy America Web site.\ne. Use of Federally Assisted Property.  The Recipient must use federally assisted property for the purpose for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the Award continues to be supported with federal assistance.  Recipients must not encumber property without prior FTA approval.  Recipients must immediately notify FTA when changing the use of their federally assisted property or withdrawing that property from use whether by planned withdrawal, misuse, or casualty loss.  When the need for federally assisted property no longer exists, see disposition requirements in Chapter IV, subsection 4.o, \u201cDisposition of Equipment and Supplies,\u201d of this Circular. (1) Continuing Control.  The recipient agrees to maintain continuing control of the use of federally assisted property and constructed improvements to the extent satisfactory to FTA.  The recipient agrees to use federally assisted property for appropriate purposes continuously for the duration of the useful life of that property, as required by FTA.  If the recipient unreasonably delays or fails to use its federally assisted property during the useful life of that property, the recipient agrees that it may be required to return the entire amount of the federal assistance expended on that property to FTA.  The recipient further agrees to notify FTA immediately when any federally assisted property is withdrawn from use under the Award or when any federally assisted property is used in a manner substantially different from the representations the recipient made in the Grant or Cooperative Agreement for the Award.\nThe recipient may make federally assisted property available for use in other Awards currently or previously supported by the Federal Government, provided such use will not interfere with the work on the Award for which it was originally acquired.  First preference must be given to other Awards supported by FTA; and second preference must be given to programs or projects of other federal agencies.  Use for non-federally assisted programs or projects is permissible in some cases, as described in the discussion of incidental use in this chapter.\nFor Awards made prior to December 26, 2014, the recipient must not use property acquired with federal assistance to provide services to compete unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services. See 49 CFR \u00a7 18.32(c)(3).\nFor Awards made on or after December 26, 2014, the recipient must not use equipment acquired with the federal Award to provide services for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services unless specifically authorized by federal statute for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.  (See 2 CFR \u00a7 200.313(c)(3)).  Non-transit use of FTA assisted property is acceptable so long as it is incidental, does not interfere with transit use (transit has priority), and income generated is retained by the recipient for transit use.  Recipients also need to be mindful that the provision of charter service is prohibited under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5323(d).  See also FTA\u2019s Charter Regulations, 49 CFR part 604.\nThe recipient agrees that it will not execute any transfer of title, lease, lien, pledge, mortgage, encumbrance, third-party contract, subagreement, grant anticipation note, alienation, innovative finance arrangement, or any other obligation pertaining to the federally assisted property that in any way would affect the continuing federal interest in the use of that federally assisted property, without written FTA approval.\n(2) Shared Use.  Shared use of federally assisted property requires prior written FTA approval except when it involves coordinated public transit human services transportation.  Shared use projects should be clearly identified and sufficient detail provided to FTA at the time of review before an Award to determine allocable costs related to non-transit use for construction, as well as ongoing maintenance, and operation costs.  See section 2 of this chapter, above, for further information related to shared use for real property whose principles apply to equipment.\n(3) Incidental Use.  Any incidental use of federally assisted property will not exceed that permitted under applicable federal laws, regulations, and directives.  Incidental use requires prior FTA approval except when it involves coordinated public transit human services transportation.  Consult your FTA regional or metropolitan office prior to incorporating incidental use activities in projects.  See section 2 of this chapter, above, for further information related to incidental use for real property whose principles apply to equipment.  Incidental use will be permitted if: a) The incidental use does not interfere with the recipient\u2019s project or public transportation operations;\nb) The recipient fully recaptures all costs related to the incidental use from the non- transit public entity or private entity, including all applicable excise taxes on fuel for fueling facilities and wear and tear to capital improvements;\nc) The recipient uses revenues received from the incidental use for capital and/or operating expenses that were or will be incurred to provide the public transportation; and\nd) Private entities pay all applicable excise taxes on fuel.\n(4) Delay or Failure to Use Federally Assisted Property.  Recipients are required to use federally assisted property continuously and appropriately throughout the useful life of the property.  Recipients may be required to return the entire amount of federal assistance spent on federally assisted property if, during its useful life, the recipient has unreasonably delayed or failed to use the federally assisted property.  Recipients are also required to notify FTA before property is removed from the transit service originally in", "doc_id": "4426e0ca-b76e-4570-a1dc-bd1c376df186", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "76377402-2037-4d04-b2f0-76c910ca129b": {"text": "tended at the time of the Award and if property is put to additional or substitute uses.\nf. Minimum Useful Life of Federally Assisted Property.  FTA provides a minimum useful life policy for capital rolling stock, trolleys, ferries, and facilities in this circular.  If property is prematurely withdrawn from service, FTA must be immediately notified (See Section 4.o.(3) of this Chapter, \u201cDisposition or Inappropriate Use Before the End of the Asset\u2019s Useful Life\u201d).   (1) Determining Minimum Useful Life for Federally Assisted Property.  The recipient should identify the method used to determine the minimum useful life.  Acceptable methods to determine minimum useful life include but are not limited to: a) Generally accepted accounting principles;\nb) Independent evaluation;\nc) Manufacturer\u2019s estimated useful life;\nd) Internal Revenue Service guidelines;\ne) Industry standards;\nf) Recipient experience;\ng) The recipient\u2019s independent auditor who needs to provide his or her concurrence that the useful life assigned to the property is reasonable for depreciation purposes; and\nh) Proven useful life developed at a federal test facility.\n(2) FTA Minimum Useful Life Policy for Rolling Stock and Ferries.  The useful life of rolling stock and ferries begins on the date the vehicle is placed in revenue service and continues until it is removed from revenue service.  The minimum useful life in years refers to total time in transit revenue service, not time spent stockpiled or otherwise unavailable for regular transit use.  The minimum useful life in miles refers to total miles in transit revenue service.  Non-revenue miles and periods of extended removal from service do not count towards useful life.  Changes in operating circumstances, including unforeseen difficulty maintaining vehicles,\nhigher cost of fuel, and changes in local law limiting where vehicles can be operated do not excuse minimum useful life requirements.\nRecipients of federal assistance need to specify the expected minimum useful life in invitations for bids when acquiring new vehicles.  Minimum useful life is determined by years of service or accumulation of miles whichever comes first, by asset type as follows:\na) Buses: 1 Large, heavy-duty transit buses including over-the-road buses (approximately 35' \u2013 40' or larger including articulated buses):\nAt least 12 years of service or an accumulation of at least 500,000 miles.\n2 Small size, heavy-duty transit buses:\nAt least 10 years or an accumulation of at least 350,000 miles.\n3 Medium-size, medium-duty transit buses:\nAt least seven years or an accumulation of at least 200,000 miles.\n4 Medium-size, light-duty transit buses:\nAt least five years or an accumulation of at least 150,000 miles.\nb) Light Duty Vehicles:\nOther light-duty vehicles used as equipment and to transport passengers (revenue service), such as regular and specialized vans, sedans, and light-duty buses including all bus models exempt from testing in the current 49 CFR part 665:\nAt least four years or an accumulation of at least 100,000 miles.\nc) Trolleys:\nThe term \u201ctrolley\u201d is often applied to a wide variety of vehicles.  Thus, the useful life depends on the type of trolley. FTA classifies trolleys and the suggested useful life as described below.  For disposition actions, FTA will use the following minimum useful life determinations:\n1 A fixed guideway steel-wheeled \u201ctrolley\u201d (streetcar or other light rail vehicle): At least 25 years,\n2 A fixed guideway electric trolley-bus with rubber tires obtaining power from overhead catenary: At least 15 years, and\n3 Simulated trolleys, with rubber tires and internal combustion engine (often termed \u201ctrolley-replica buses\u201d). Please refer to bus useful life criteria above.\nd) Rail Vehicles.  At time of application, the recipient may propose an alternative useful life to be reviewed by FTA.  A recipient that regularly measures lifespan by hours of operations, or by any other measure, may develop an appropriate methodology for converting its system to years of service.  The reasonableness of such methodologies will be subject to examination, particularly if the recipient proposes to retire a rail vehicle before reaching FTA\u2019s useful life.  At least 25 years.\ne) Ferries.  The useful life of a ferry depends on several factors, including the type and use of the ferry.  FTA recommends using one of the methods outlined in Chapter IV, subsection 4.f.(1) above or offers the following suggested minimum service lives: 1 Passenger ferries: At least 25 years,\n2 Other ferries (without overhaul): At least 30 years, and\n3 Other ferries (with overhaul): At least 60 years.\nf) Facilities.  Determining the useful life of a facility must take into consideration such factors as the type of construction, nature of the equipment used, historical usage patterns, and technological developments.  Based on any of the methods identified above in Chapter IV, Paragraph 4.f(1), a railroad or highway structure has a minimum useful life of 50 years, and most other buildings and facilities (concrete, steel, and frame construction) have a useful life of 40 years.\ng. Rolling Stock Rebuilding Policies.  FTA laws, regulations, policies, and procedures permit the use of capital assistance for vehicle rebuilding programs that meet the vehicle requirements in the Federal Motor Carrier Vehicle Safety Standards, 49 CFR part 571, and Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Specifications for Transportation, 49 CFR part 38.  Requirements are summarized below: (1) Buses to be rebuilt must be at the end of their minimum useful life and in need of major structural and/or mechanical rebuilding.  The age of the bus to be rebuilt is its years of service at the time the rebuilding begins.  The eligibility of this major capital bus rebuild work is in addition to the eligibility of vehicle overhauls as described in Chapter IV, subsection 4.h, \u201cRolling Stock Overhauls,\u201d below.  Recipients should contact the regional or metropolitan office to determine the extent to which the useful life of the bus is affected by the rebuild.  The minimum extension of useful life is four years, or miles equivalent to four years.\nWith prior approval, FTA may permit the recipient to rebuild a vehicle that has not yet met its minimum useful life.  In such circumstances, the minimum useful life of\nthe rebuilt vehicle is the remaining useful life of the vehicle at time of rebuild plus four years, or miles equivalent to four years (e.g., for a 12-year bus rebuilt at 11 years, the remaining useful life would be 5 years).\n(2) Railcars to be rebuilt must have reached the end of their minimum useful life (end-of-life rebuild).  The minimum extension of useful life is 10 years.  The eligibility of this major capital rail rebuild work is in addition to the eligibility for vehicle overhauls as described below in Chapter IV, subsection 4.h, \u201cRolling Stock Overhauls.\u201d\nWith prior approval, FTA may permit the recipient to rebuild a railcar that has not yet met minimum useful life.  In such circumstances, the minimum useful life of the rebuilt railcar is the remaining useful life in the railcar at time of rebuild plus ten years (e.g., for a 25-year railcar rebuilt at 24 years, the remaining useful life would be 11 years).\nDepending upon the extent of rebuilding planned, the rebuild may be subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.\nh. Rolling Stock Overhauls.  Rolling stock overhauls are an eligible capital expense as preventive maintenance.  This eligibility for capital assistance applies also to rolling stock that has been leased or acquired by a contractor, and to contracted service.  Overhauls are usually done to make sure rolling stock reaches its useful life.  Overhaul does not extend the useful life of rolling stock.  This eligibility is in addition to eligibility of rebuilding specifically discussed above in Chapter IV, subsection 4.g.  For rolling stock to be overhauled, it must have accumulated at least 40 percent of its useful life.\ni. Rolling Stock Repowering.  Rolling stock repowering involves replacing a vehicle\u2019s propulsion system with a propulsion system of a different type (e.g., replacing a diesel engine with an electric battery propulsion system).  Rolling stock repowering is permitted for buses that have met at least 40 percent of their useful life in which case it must be designed to permit the bus to meet its useful life requirements or as part of a rebuild in which case it must extend the useful life by at least 4 years, or an additional 125,000 miles.\nj. Previously-Owned Vehicles (Including Remanufactured Vehicles).  Previously-owned and remanufactured vehicles must meet the following requirements: (1) Procurement.  The recipient must identify in their procurement their intent to purchase previously-owned and/or remanufactured vehicles.  As part of the bid or proposal the recipient must obtain certification and documentation ascertaining that applicable Bus Testing and Buy America requirements have been met by the original owner or remanufacturer.\n(2) Useful Life.  The grant application and procurement of a previously-owned vehicle must identify the applicable useful life for the vehicle.\n(3) Bus Testing.  The original vehicles must have met the Bus Testing Requirements in place at the time of acquisition by the original owner.\n(4) Buy America.  The original vehicles must have met the Buy America requirements in place at the time of acquisition by the original owner.  Remanufactured vehicles must meet the applicable Buy America requirements for rolling stock for all new components and subcomponents added or replaced on the vehicle.\n(5) DBE Requirements. When a remanufacturer responds to a solicitation for new, or remanufactured vehicles, with a vehicle that has post-production alterations or retro-fitting to provide a \u201clike new\u201d vehicle, the remanufacturer is considered a transit vehicle manufacturer and must comply with the DOT DBE regulations.\nk", "doc_id": "76377402-2037-4d04-b2f0-76c910ca129b", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "5a9b0953-4f18-466c-baa2-2fa30ac6f311": {"text": ". Rolling Stock Spare Ratio Policies.  Spare ratios will be taken into account in the review of Award proposed to replace, rebuild, or acquire additional vehicles.  Spare ratio is defined as the total number of spare vehicles available for fixed-route service (regardless of type) divided by the total number of fixed-route vehicles required for annual maximum service (regardless of type).  Spare ratio is usually expressed as a percentage, e.g., 100 vehicles required for maximum fixed-route service and 20 spare vehicles is a 20 percent spare ratio.  Spare ratios are calculated for the transit system as a whole, not by vehicle type.\nFor purposes of the spare ratio calculation, \u201cvehicles operated in maximum fixed-route service\u201d is defined as the total number of revenue vehicles operated to meet the annual maximum service requirement.  This is the revenue vehicle count during the peak week, day and hours maximum service is provided.  It excludes atypical days and special events.\n(1) Bus Fleet.  The basis for determining a reasonable spare bus ratio takes local circumstances into account.  The number of spare buses in the active fleet for recipients operating 50 or more fixed-route revenue vehicles should not exceed 20 percent of the number of vehicles operated in maximum fixed-route service.  FTA does not set a specific spare ratio for smaller operators, but expects the number of spare buses to be reasonable, taking into account the number of vehicles and variety of vehicle types and sizes.\nBuses delivered for future expansion and buses that have been replaced, but are in the process of being disposed of, are not included in the calculation of spare ratio.\nFor each application identified to acquire vehicles, the applicant should address the subjects of current spare ratio, the spare ratio anticipated at the time the new vehicles are introduced into service, disposition of vehicles to be replaced including information on age and mileage, and the applicant\u2019s conformance with FTA\u2019s spare ratio guideline.  An applicant is required to notify FTA if the spare ratio computation on which the application is based is significantly altered before the Award is made.\n(2) Rail Fleet.  Because rail transit operations tend to be highly individualized, FTA has not established a specific number to serve as an acceptable spare ratio for rail transit operations.  Nevertheless, rail operators should be aware that the recipient\u2019s rail vehicle spare ratio and the rationale underlying that spare ratio will be examined during the triennial review whenever FTA assistance is used to purchase or rebuild rail vehicles.\nThe following guidance should be used to support an operator\u2019s proposed rail vehicle spare ratio when the spare ratio is under review by FTA:\na) An operator of a rail system should have in its file available upon request by FTA a rail fleet management plan that addresses operating policies (level of service requirements; train failure definitions, and actions); peak vehicle requirements (service period and make-up, e.g., standby trains); maintenance and overhaul programs (scheduled, unscheduled, and overhaul); system and service expansions; railcar procurements and related schedules; and spare ratio justifications.\nb) The spare ratio justification should consider the average number of railcars out of service for scheduled maintenance, the unscheduled maintenance and overhaul program, the allowance for ridership variation (historical data), ridership changes that affect railcar needs caused by expansion of the system or services, the contingency for destroyed railcars, and railcar procurements for replacements and system expansions.\nc) Railcars delivered for future expansion and railcars that have been replaced, but are in the process of being disposed of, should not be included in the calculation of spare ratio.\nd) Peak Vehicle Requirements include \u201cstandby\u201d trains that are scheduled, ready for service, and have a designated crew.\ne) Factors that may influence spare ratios are the type of equipment (locomotive hauled trains; married pair units or single railcars, equipment design, reliability, and age), environmental conditions (weather, above ground or underground operation, loading and track layout), operational policies (standby trains, load factors, headways), maintenance policies (conditions for removing railcars from service, maintenance during nights and weekends, and labor agreement conditions), and maintenance facilities and staff capabilities.\n(3) Spare Ratio Deviation.  Recipients of buses recently procured may temporarily exceed their spare ratio thresholds.  In those cases, recipients may seek a short-term deviation from the spare ratio requirements for small deviations.  Recipients should prepare a brief justification explaining the reason for the deviation, a date by which the fleet spare ratio will come into compliance with the general requirements, and the recipient\u2019s plans to come into compliance.  The deviation will generally be\ngranted for no more than two (2) years and must be approved by the regional administrator either in writing or by approval of the Award.\nRecipients must promptly inform the Regional Office of any significant changes related to spare ratios, including plans for disposition or acquisition of vehicles and changes in vehicle needs.\n(4) Contingency Fleet. FTA recognizes two types of vehicles\u2014active and contingency.  Revenue rolling stock stockpiled in a contingency fleet in preparation for emergencies must have met their minimum useful life requirements and must be properly stored, maintained, and documented in a contingency plan.  FTA will also permit agencies to include vehicles that have met their minimum useful life in their contingency fleet if an agency is introducing zero emission vehicles into its fleet.  These vehicles are not included in the calculation of spare ratio.  Contingency plans are subject to review during triennial reviews and other FTA oversight reviews.  Any rolling stock not supported by a contingency plan will be considered part of the active fleet.\nContingency fleet means inactive rolling stock reserved or retained for emergencies or other unforeseen and justified activities.  These activities could include the evacuation of people during an emergency, use as crowd control or traffic barriers, loaners to other transit agencies during a justified need, temporary replacements for buses in the active fleet during major active fleet overhauls or bus maintenance activities and other activities that take a portion of the active fleet temporarily out of service.\nThe recipient should keep a record of information that demonstrates the need for the contingency fleet activation, the justification for activation and the period of time of activation.  The contingency fleet plan should demonstrate that the bus has met its useful life by identifying the year the bus was placed in service, the year and mileage when removed from service and the useful life of the bus in years and miles.  The plan should identify where the buses will be stored, how they will be protected and list the maintenance activities performed on the bus to ensure they maintain their contingency bus fleet status.\nA contingency fleet is separate from the spare fleet, and is not included in the spare ratio.\nl. Leases.  FTA and standard accounting rules distinguish between operating and capital leases.\n(1) Capital Lease.  A capital lease is any transaction whereby the grantee acquires the right to use a capital asset.  If a lease does not have the following characteristics, it is an operating lease:   a) the lease cannot be cancelled; and\nb) any one of the following is true:   1 the term of the lease is equal to or greater than 75 percent of the useful life of the asset;\n2 the grantee will become the owner of the asset at the end of the lease term;\n3 the lease contains an option to purchase the leased property at a bargain price;\n4 the present value of the rent is equal to 90 percent of the value of the property.\n(2) Capital Leases in General.  The FAST Act amended the definition of \u201ccapital project\u201d to remove the requirement that a capital lease be \u201csubject to regulations that the Secretary prescribes limiting the leasing arrangements to those that are more cost-effective than purchase or construction.\u201d This applies to any lease financed with FTA assistance.  As a result, 49 CFR part 639, subpart C, pertaining to cost effectiveness requirements, does not apply to capital leases:\nA lease may qualify for capital assistance if it meets the following criteria:\na) The capital asset to be acquired by lease is eligible for capital assistance; and\nb) There is or will be no existing federal interest in the capital asset as of the date the lease will take effect.\nFor the purposes of this definition, it does not matter if the lease qualifies as a tax exempt municipal lease in which the private lender holding the lease would not pay income taxes on the interest earned from the lease payments received.\n(3) Capital Leases Under Section 3019(c) of the FAST Act.  Section 3019 of the FAST Act established an \u201cInnovative Procurement\u201d program, of which one purpose is to establish new conditions pertaining to the leasing of \u201crolling stock or related equipment.\u201d For purposes of Section 3019(c), a capital lease is defined as any agreement in which a recipient acquires the right to use rolling stock or related equipment for a specified period of time, in exchange for a periodic payment.  Therefore, Section 3019 provisions are limited to leases of rolling stock or related equipment. a) Eligible lease costs of rolling stock or related equipment include the costs of the rolling stock or related equipment; associated financing costs, including interest, legal fees, and financial advisor fees; ancillary costs such as delivery and installation charges; and maintenance costs.  A capital lease may also require that the lessor provide maintena", "doc_id": "5a9b0953-4f18-466c-baa2-2fa30ac6f311", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "257ee01f-12a7-4323-8437-03a0c3e7e2c2": {"text": "nce of the rolling stock or related equipment covered by the lease.  The purchase calculation should include an estimate of residual value.\nRemovable power sources for zero emission vehicles may be acquired separately as capital leases.\nb) Based on standard FTA Award management guidelines, recipients must maintain an inventory of assets acquired through capital leasing and must maintain on their accounting records the lease liability.\nc) Terms.  A recipient shall negotiate the terms of any lease agreement that the recipient enters into.\nd) Applicability of procurement requirements. 1 Lease requirements. \u2014 Part 639, subpart C, of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, \u201cCost Effectiveness\u201d or any successor regulation, and implementing guidance applicable to leasing is no longer applicable.  Eligibility of lease expenses is instead governed by 2 CFR 200. a Buy America.\u2014The requirements under section 5323(j) of title 49, United States Code, shall apply to a capital lease.\n2 Removable power sources are subject to section 2 CFR \u00a7 200.88 \u201cSimplified Acquisition Threshold.\u201d  Those leases, even those over the threshold (currently $150,000), may use small purchase procedures.\ne) Lease Reporting Requirements.  Not later than 3 years after the date in which a recipient enters into a capital lease for rolling stock or related equipment, the recipient must submit a report in TrAMS that contains: 1 An evaluation of the overall costs and benefits of leasing rolling stock, (including both the base and option years); and\n2 A comparison of the expected short-term and long-term maintenance costs of leasing versus buying rolling stock.\n(4) The Recipient as Lessor.  In all instances in which the recipient is a lessor (the party leasing an asset to another), the recipient must obtain FTA\u2019s written concurrence before leasing federally assisted assets to others.  In addition, for equipment leasing, recipients must comply with FTA\u2019s Charter Service regulations, School Bus Operations regulations, and with requirements below:\n(5) Leasing FTA Assisted Assets to Others for Transit Service.  The recipient may enter into a contract for leasing its federally assisted property to a private operator (the lessee).  The lease must be subject to and incorporate by reference the terms and conditions of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  Under this arrangement, the recipient (the lessor) should include the following provisions in the proposed lease agreement: 1 The federally assisted property shall be operated by the lessee to serve the best interests and welfare of the recipient, lessor, and the public; the terms and conditions for operation of service imposed by the recipient shall be evidenced in a service agreement;\n2 The lessee shall maintain the federally assisted property at a high level of cleanliness, safety, and mechanical soundness under maintenance procedures outlined by the recipient; the recipient, lessor, and/or FTA shall have the right to conduct periodic maintenance inspections for the purpose of confirming the existence, condition, and the proper maintenance of the federally assisted property; and\n3 The lease needs to cross reference a service agreement.  A default under the lease is a default under the service agreement and vice versa.\nm. Transit Asset Management (TAM) Regulations.  All recipients and subrecipients of FTA federal assistance must follow the regulations found in 49 CFR part 625, \u201cTransit Asset Management,\u201d including the requirement to develop or participate in the development of a Transit Asset Management Plan, or a Group Plan, by October 1, 2018, and amendments to 49 CFR part 630, \u201cNational Transit Database,\u201d which includes reporting requirements.\nn. Management of Federally Assisted Property.  Rolling stock and equipment management procedures include the following minimum requirements:  (1) Equipment records must be maintained by the recipient.  Records must include the following:  a) A description of the asset;\nb) The identification number or serial number;\nc) The entity or individual that holds title to the asset;\nd) The source of funding (the FAIN number under which it was procured);\ne) The acquisition date;\nf) The cost of the asset;\ng) The percentage of federal participation in the cost;\nh) The location;\ni) The use and condition;\nj) The useful life; and\nk) The disposition data, including the date of disposal and sale price, or, where applicable, method used to determine its fair market value.\n(2) A physical inventory of the equipment must be taken and the results reconciled with equipment records at least once every two years.  Any differences must be investigated to determine the cause of the difference.  Property should be tagged or otherwise identified as federally assisted property.\n(3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of federally assisted property.  The recipient must investigate and document any loss, damage, or theft.\n(4) Maintenance and Warranty. a) Maintenance.  Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed and implemented to keep the federally assisted property in good condition.  Recipients must maintain federally assisted property in good operating order and in compliance with any applicable federal regulations that may be issued and follow applicable guidance that may be issued, except to the extent that FTA determines otherwise in writing.  Recipients must have a written vehicle maintenance plan and a facility/equipment maintenance plan.  These plans should describe a system of periodic inspections and preventive maintenance to be performed at certain defined intervals.\nb) Records and Oversight.  Recipients must keep satisfactory records pertaining to the use of federally assisted property, and submit to FTA upon request such information as may be required to assure compliance with federal requirements.  Recipients must have appropriate procedures in place to ensure that management and oversight of federally assisted property is properly administered for assets controlled by subrecipients.\nc) Warranties.  Warranties, when part of rolling stock and equipment contracts, should provide for correction of defective or unacceptable materials or workmanship.  These warranties should specify coverage and duration and meet currently available industry standards.  A general warranty incorporating industry standards and an extended warranty are eligible capital costs.  FTA\u2019s Best Practices Procurement Manual encourages recipients to evaluate the cost of an extended warranty in an analysis separate from the equipment\u2019s acquisition cost, in order to make a good business decision.  Recipients are responsible for: 1 Establishing and maintaining a system for recording warranty claims; this system should provide information needed by the recipient on the extent and provisions of coverage and on claims processing procedures; and\n2 Identifying and diligently enforcing the system for recording warranty claims.\no. Disposition of Equipment and Supplies.  Disposition requirements apply to equipment that has met its useful life, as well as equipment that is prematurely withdrawn from service before its useful life has been ended.  FTA retains financial interest in equipment\nwith a unit value exceeding $5000, and supplies with an aggregate value exceeding $5000, even if useful life has been met.  State recipients must dispose of federally assisted property acquired under an Award by the state in accordance with state laws and procedures.  Subrecipients of states will follow such policies and procedures allowed by the state with respect to disposition of equipment acquired under an FTA Award.   (1) Calculating the Federal Interest.  FTA is entitled to its share of the remaining federal interest upon disposition of federally assisted property before the end of its useful life or for a value greater than $5,000 after the useful life has been met.    a) The federal interest is determined by calculating the fair market value of the federally assisted property immediately before the occurrence prompting the withdrawal of that property from appropriate use (e.g., sale, loss, etc.).  The federal interest that the recipient is required to return to FTA is the greater of FTA\u2019s share of the unamortized value of the remaining useful life per unit, based on straight line depreciation of the original purchase price or the federal share of the sales price.  The following example is provided to determine the straight line depreciation of a vehicle: for a vehicle with a 12-year, 500,000-mile minimum useful life, the vehicle\u2019s value decreases each year by one-twelfth of its original purchase price.  Alternatively, the value decreases for each mile driven 1/500,000 of its original purchase price.  The unamortized value of the remaining useful life per unit is the value obtained by calculating the straight line depreciation based on either miles or years whichever is more advantageous to the recipient.\nb) Any exchange of funds or trade of equipment or services in consideration for the federally assisted property is considered a sale.  The sales price is based on the value of the funds, equipment, or services provided by the purchaser, and the federal share of that price is calculated as described above.  Recipients and purchasers may not separate any portion of the sales prices as reimbursement in order to reduce the federal share.\nc) If the recipient is authorized to sell the property, it will be required to employ proper sales procedures that ensure the highest possible return is achieved in the disposition of the federally assisted asset.\nd) Reimbursement to FTA will be an amount calculated by multiplying the total aggregate fair market value at the time of disposition, or the net sale proceeds, by the percentage of FTA\u2019s participation in the original Award.  The recipient\u2019s transmittal letter should state whether the equipment will be retained or sold.  Use of sale", "doc_id": "257ee01f-12a7-4323-8437-03a0c3e7e2c2", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "d2741f9a-33e1-4eb4-b6de-65e0d106775b": {"text": "s proceeds are discussed elsewhere.\n(2) Replacement at End of Minimum Useful Life.  Federally assisted property to be replaced must have achieved at least the minimum useful life.  For purposes of bus replacement, the age of the bus to be replaced is its years of service or mileage at the time the proposed new bus is introduced into service.  For purposes of a rail vehicle replacement, the age of the vehicle to be replaced is its age at the time the\nnew vehicle is introduced into service.  Official property records (or a Rolling Stock Status Report), in which future needs (expansion and replacement) are discussed, must be available upon request by FTA.  Proceeds from the sale of real property, equipment, or supplies are not program income.\n(3) Disposition or Inappropriate Use Before the End of the Asset\u2019s Useful Life.  Any disposition of federally assisted property before the end of its useful life requires prior FTA approval.  FTA is entitled to its share of the remaining federal interest.   a) Transfer of Assets No Longer Needed.  For an asset that has not met its useful life and with prior FTA approval, the recipient may follow procedures for 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(h)(1) \u2013 (3) to transfer federally assisted property (real property, including land, or equipment) to a public agency for non-public transportation use provided the recipient can demonstrate that: 1 The asset will remain in public use for at least five years after the date the asset is transferred;\n2 There is no purpose eligible for assistance for which the asset should be used;\n3 The overall benefit of allowing the transfer is greater than the FTA interest in liquidation and return of FTA\u2019s remaining federal interest in the asset, after considering fair market value and other factors; and\n4 Through an appropriate screening or survey process (usually by following procedures for publication in the Federal Register), that there is no interest in acquiring the asset for the federal use if the asset is a facility or land.\nAdditional information regarding this type of disposition is available from your FTA Regional or Metropolitan Office.\nb) Casualty, Fire, Natural Disaster, and Misused Property.  When federally assisted property is lost or damaged by fire, casualty, or natural disaster, the fair market value shall be calculated on the basis of the condition of the equipment or supplies immediately before the fire, casualty, or natural disaster, irrespective of the extent of insurance coverage.  If any damage to the federally assisted property results from abuse or misuse occurring with the recipient\u2019s knowledge and consent, the recipient agrees to restore the federally assisted property to its original condition or refund the value of the federal interest in that property.\nThe recipient may fulfill its obligations to remit the federal interest by either:\n1 With prior FTA approval, following the Like-Kind Exchange Policy as described in subparagraph (d) below; or\n2 Returning to FTA an amount equal to the remaining federal interest in the withdrawn federally assisted property.\nc) Insurance Proceeds.  If the recipient receives insurance proceeds when federally assisted property has been lost or damaged by fire, casualty, or natural disaster, the recipient agrees to: 1 Apply those proceeds to the cost of replacing the federally assisted property that is damaged or destroyed or taken out of service; or\n2 Return to FTA an amount equal to the remaining federal interest in the federally assisted property that is lost, damaged, or destroyed.\nThe federal interest does not depend on the extent of insurance coverage or on the insurance adjustment received.\nExamples appear on the next page.\nApplication of Insurance Proceeds: Example 1\nInsurance Proceeds Greater than the\nRemaining Federal Interest in the Damaged or Destroyed Property.\nThe remaining federal interest in the damaged or destroyed property is $1,800.  The recipient receives insurance proceeds in the amount of $2,500.  The recipient is required to apply $1,800 of the $2,500 insurance proceeds towards the federal share of replacing the destroyed property.\nCost of Replacement Property: (Total Project Cost)\n$6,000\n\nFed Share: $4,800\nLocal: $1,200\nLess Federal Share of Insurance Proceeds:\n<$1,800>\nAdditional Federal Funds:\n$3,000\nIf the funding ratio for this property were 80 percent federal and 20 percent non-federal, the replacement property could be purchased for $4,800 federal/$1,200 non-federal funds.  The insurance proceeds of $1,800 needed to cover the remaining federal interest in the damaged and destroyed property must first be applied to the federal share of the replacement property.  The recipient could receive an additional $3,000 in federal assistance.  The recipient must provide $1,200 in non-federal share to replace the property.\n\nApplication of Insurance Proceeds: Example 2\nInsurance Proceeds Less than the\nRemaining Federal Interest in the Damaged or Destroyed Property:\nIf the federal interest in the damaged or destroyed property is $1,800 and the recipient receives insurance proceeds in the amount of $500, the recipient is required to apply the $500 of insurance proceeds and $1,300 of non-federal funds to equal the remaining federal interest, towards the cost of the replacement property.\nCost of Replacement Property: (Total Project Cost)\n$6,000\n\nFed Share: $4,800\nLocal: $1,200\nLess: Insurance Proceeds:\n$500\nNon-Federal Funds to Cover the Remaining Federal Interest:\n$1,300\nAdditional Federal Funds:\n$3,000\nIf the funding ratio for this property were 80 percent federal and 20 percent non-federal, the replacement property could be purchased for $4,800 federal/$1,200 non-federal funds.  The insurance proceeds of $500 plus an additional $1,300 in non-federal funds are needed to cover the remaining federal interest in the damaged and destroyed property.  These funds must be applied to the federal share of the replacement property.  The recipient could receive an additional $3,000 in federal assistance, and must provide an additional $1,200 in other non-federal share, to replace the property.  In total, the $6,000 is therefore covered by $500 in insurance, $3,000 in federal funds and $2,500 in non-federal funds.\n\nd) Like-Kind Exchange Policy.  With prior FTA approval, equipment may be disposed of before the end of its minimum useful life.  In lieu of returning the federal share to FTA, a recipient may elect to transfer the remaining federal interest to a replacement equipment of like kind.  For example, \u201cLike-Kind\u201d is defined as a bus for a bus with a similar useful life and a rail vehicle for a rail vehicle.  Under the Like-Kind Exchange Policy, proceeds from the federal share of the equipment disposition are not returned to FTA; instead, all proceeds are reinvested in acquisition of the like-kind replacement equipment.  If the disposition proceeds are less than the amount of the federal interest in the equipment at the time it is being replaced, the recipient is responsible for providing the difference, along with the recipient\u2019s share of the cost of the replacement equipment.  If sales proceeds are greater than the amount of the federal interest in the equipment traded in or sold, the investment of all proceeds in acquisition of the like-kind replacement equipment results in a reduction of the gross project cost.  An example (on the following page) of like-kind exchange is:\n\nExample: Like-Kind exchange\nA recipient purchased a new bus in 2009 for $220,000; 80 percent of the total price, or $176,000, was federal assistance while 20 percent, or $44,000, was non-federal.  Thus, there was an initial $176,000 \u201cfederal interest\u201d in the new vehicle.\nInstead of keeping the bus in service for 12 years, the FTA useful life of a new bus, the recipient chose to sell the bus after six years and replace it with a new vehicle.\nSince the bus had a minimum useful life of 12 years and its depreciation was determined on a \u201cstraight line\u201d basis, the depreciated value of the vehicle after six years was half the original price, or $110,000.  The remaining federal interest was 80 percent of that figure, $88,000.\nAssume, for example, the recipient realized $80,000 from the sale of the six-year-old bus, or $30,000 less than the straight line depreciated value of the original vehicle.\nThe recipient purchased the new bus in 2015 for $240,000 calculated as follows on the next page:\nNet Project Cost Calculation:\nGross Project Cost of New Bus:   $240,000\nLess Straight-Line Depreciated Value of Replaced Bus: - $110,000*\nNet Project Cost:   $130,000\nFederal Share 80%:   $104,000\nNon-federal Share 20%:   $ 26,000\nTotal:   $130,000\nRevised Federal Interest in New Bus:\nTransferred from the Old Vehicle:   $ 88,000\nFederal Share of the New Grant:   $104,000\n$192,000\n*Note: As the sale proceeds of $80,000 are less than the straight-line depreciated value of $110,000 the recipient must provide an additional $30,000 to pay for the $240,000 vehicle.\ne) If the property has never been used for appropriate purposes, the recipient shall sell the property and pay FTA the greater of FTA\u2019s share of the fair market value or the entire amount of federal assistance spent on that federally assisted property\n(4) Disposition or Use of Assets for Other Than Purposes of the Award after the End of Their Useful Life. a) Retain and Use Elsewhere.  After the minimum useful life of federally assisted property is reached or the property is no longer needed for the original Award, it may be used by the recipient for other transit projects or programs.  FTA prior approval of this alternative is not required.  FTA retains its interest in the federally assisted property if its fair market value exceeds $5,000.\nb) Disposition of Property with a Fair Market Value of More Than $5,000.  After the useful life of federally assisted property is reached, or the property is no longer needed for the original Award, rolling stock and equipment with a current market value exceed", "doc_id": "d2741f9a-33e1-4eb4-b6de-65e0d106775b", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "b98d23b1-9350-4e69-b3dd-759c4cbc9b79": {"text": "ing $5,000 per unit, or unused supplies with a total aggregate fair market value of more than $5,000, may be retained or sold.  FTA is entitled to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value, or proceeds from sale, by FTA\u2019s percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase.  Rolling stock and equipment that is sold may have the amount due FTA reduced by an amount of $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for its selling and handling expenses.\nc) Sell and Use the Proceeds for Other Capital Awards, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(h)(4).  After the useful life is met, or the property is no longer needed, and with prior FTA approval, the recipient may sell its federally assisted property for which there is no longer any public transportation purposes and use the proceeds to reduce the gross project cost of other future FTA eligible capital transit Awards.  The recipient is expected to record the receipt of the proceeds in the recipient\u2019s accounting system, showing that the funds are restricted for use in a future capital Award, and reduce the liability as the proceeds are applied to one or more FTA approved capital Awards.  If new applications are not immediately anticipated, the recipient must inform the appropriate FTA contact of the disposition within a reasonable amount of time.  Otherwise, the subsequent capital application should contain information showing FTA that the gross project cost has been reduced with proceeds from the earlier transaction.  The proceeds cannot retroactively be applied to an existing Award or project unless the Award is still open.\nd) Disposition of Property with a Fair Market Value of $5,000 or Less Value.  After the useful life of its federally assisted property is reached, rolling stock and equipment with a unit market value of $5,000 or less, or supplies with a total aggregate market value of $5,000 or less, may be retained, sold, or\notherwise disposed of with no obligation to reimburse FTA.  Records of this action must be retained.  FTA approval of this action is not required.\ne) Transfer of Rolling Stock\u2014Recipient-to-Recipient.  With prior FTA approval, a recipient may transfer rolling stock that has not yet served its useful life to another recipient.  The federal interest in the rolling stock will be transferred with the rolling stock, and therefore, there is no obligation to reimburse FTA.  However, no additional FTA assistance may be used to acquire the vehicles.  Both recipients should coordinate with their FTA Regional Office(s).  The required information must be provided by the appropriate contacts for both affected transit agencies, which agencies might be in different Regional Offices.  When the rolling stock has remaining useful life, the following information should be submitted: 1 A Written Request for Approval to Transfer or Receive Vehicles.  The request should include the transferor/transferee recipient\u2019s name, list of vehicles (year, make, model), date placed in revenue service, date removed from revenue service, federal award identification number that was assigned to the original FTA Award that financed the vehicle, mileage, remaining useful life, federal share of remaining useful life, and reasons for transfer.\n2 A Board Resolution (or Other Appropriate Legal Action) from Each Recipient.  The transferring recipient\u2019s board resolution (or other appropriate legal action) should identify the receiving recipient, include a statement that the vehicles are no longer required, a list of the vehicles to be transferred including the Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs), and the remaining federal interest that is transferred to the receiving recipient.\nThe receiving recipient\u2019s board resolution (or other appropriate legal action) should identify the transferring recipient, a statement that the vehicles are needed for revenue service, a list of the vehicles to be acquired including VINs, the remaining federal interest for each vehicles, agreement that the vehicles will be maintained in accordance and in compliance with FTA requirements, and that the transferred vehicles will be included in its equipment inventory records.\n3 A Rolling Stock Status Report.  Each recipient should provide a Rolling Stock Status Report that includes all information as identified in Appendix E.  The Rolling Stock Status Report should reflect the impact that the transfer/addition of the vehicles will have on the recipient\u2019s total fleet and spare ratio.  If approved, the receiving recipient will be directed to include the transferred vehicles in its next application for federal assistance.\nf) Unused Supplies.  For the disposition of supplies for which there is no transit use with a total aggregate fair market value that exceeds $5,000, the recipient\nmust compensate FTA for its share, or transfer the sales proceeds to another Award to reduce the gross project cost of other future capital project(s), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5334(h)(4).\np. Insurance.  At a minimum, the recipient agrees to comply with the insurance requirements normally imposed by its state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances, except to the extent that the Federal Government determines otherwise in writing.   (1) Flood Insurance.  The Recipient agrees to have flood insurance as required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4012a(a), for any building located in a special flood hazard area (100-year flood zone), before receiving federal assistance to acquire, construct, reconstruct, repair, or improve that building.  Additionally, the building and its contents must be covered by flood insurance in an amount at least equal to the federal investment (less estimated land cost) or equal to the maximum limit of coverage made available with respect to the particular type of property under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.  Current limits are $500,000 per building and $500,000 for the contents of each building.\nFTA has defined building and contents coverage in its Emergency Relief rule, 49 CFR part 602, as follows:\na) Building.  For insurance purposes, a structure with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site.  This includes manufactured or modular office trailers that are built on a permanent chassis, transported to a site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation.\nb) Contents coverage.  For insurance purposes, contents are personal property within a building, including fixtures, machinery, equipment and supplies.  In addition to the costs to repair or replace, contents insurance coverage shall include the cost of debris removal and the reasonable cost of removal of contents to minimize damage.\n(2) Minimum Insurance.  The recipient must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved with federal assistance as provided to property owned by the recipient.\n(3) Insurance Proceeds.  If the recipient receives insurance proceeds when federally assisted property has been lost or damaged by fire, casualty, or natural disaster, the recipient agrees to: a) Apply those proceeds to the cost of replacing the federally assisted property that is damaged, destroyed, or taken out of service (listed on the preceding pages are two examples of the application of insurance proceeds); or\nb) Return to FTA an amount equal to the remaining federal interest in the federally assisted property that is lost, damaged, or destroyed.\n(4) Federal Interest.  The federal interest is not dependent on the extent of insurance coverage or on the insurance adjustment received.\n(5) Flood Risk Management.  Executive Order No. 13690, \u201cEstablishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for Further Soliciting and considering Stakeholder Input,\u201d was issued to improve the nation\u2019s resilience to flooding and to better prepare for the impacts of climate change.  This order identifies a process to avoid action in or impacting the floodplain and minimizing potential harm if an action must occur in or otherwise impact the floodplain.  If avoiding the floodplain is not possible, the Order calls for recipients to improve the resilience of communities and federal actions.  All FTA recipients receiving funding for infrastructure projects of facilities are required to follow E.O. 11988, as amended by E.O. 13690, which includes assessment of flood risk associated with proposed projects in floodplains.\n5. DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES.  Recipients are encouraged to consult FTA\u2019s Web site to review the \u201cProject and Construction Management Guidelines\u201d and the \u201cConstruction Project Management Handbook\u201d for guidance on the development and management of construction Awards.  These two resources can be found at https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grant-programs/capital-investments/project-and-construction-management-guidelines.\nThe \u201cProject and Construction Management Guidelines\u201d have been developed to assist those involved in advancing transit capital Award to achieve implementation success in terms of the project scope of work, function, schedule, cost, and quality.  Use of the \u201cProject and Construction and Management Guidelines\u201d should contribute to effective project management on the part of the recipient, and effective oversight and guidance by FTA and the Project Management Oversight (PMO) contractor.  Each phase of a construction project within an Award should: (1) start with inputs or a baseline, and (2) have a process that refines the project definition and generates outputs that become the inputs or baseline for the subsequent phase.  By defining the requirements for each phase and sound approaches to their accomplishment, the \u201cProject and Construction Management Guidelines\u201d allow recipients to define construction requirements, allocate resources, perform activities, monitor progress, and make adjustments, as required, to obtain the proper information and assure decisions are", "doc_id": "b98d23b1-9350-4e69-b3dd-759c4cbc9b79", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "d8fa140e-60df-420f-ab3d-c4ade22b7c7a": {"text": " made at the appropriate time.  Adherence to the guidelines should minimize scope of work changes, schedule slippages, cost overruns, and quality problems, and contribute to fully meeting all the performance objectives of the transit capital Award.\nThe purpose of the \u201cConstruction Project Management Handbook\u201d is to provide guidelines for use by public transit agencies undertaking substantial construction projects within an Award, either for the first time or with little prior experience with construction project management.  The handbook provides a comprehensive introduction to construction project management, including the applicability of the principles of project management and of all phases of project development\u2014from project initiation through planning, environmental clearance, real estate acquisition, design, construction, commissioning, and closeout.  The handbook provides guidance tailored more to agencies that are constructing maintenance and\noperational facilities, intermodal terminals, park-and-ride stations, and other similar supporting transit facilities.\na. Environmental Mitigation.\nAll projects seeking FTA assistance require compliance with NEPA implementing regulations, 40 CFR parts 1500-1508, FHWA and FTA\u2019s Environmental Impact and Related Procedures, 23 CFR part 771, and other environmental laws, regulations, and Executive Orders such as regulations pertaining to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act.  The process for preparing an EIS, EA, and CE under NEPA and completing any environmental permit, approval, review, or study required for a project under federal laws, regulations, and orders is commonly referred to as the \u201cenvironmental review process,\u201d 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 139.  FTA\u2019s policy is \u201cthat measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts be incorporated into the proposed actions.\u201d Measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts are eligible for federal assistance when FTA determines that: (1) the impacts for which the mitigation is proposed actually result from the project under review, and (2) the proposed mitigation represents a reasonable public expenditure after considering the impacts of the action and the benefits of the proposed mitigation measures, 23 CFR \u00a7 771.105(d).\nFTA considers mitigation measures for all adverse environmental and community impacts under NEPA and for specific resources under Section 4(f), the Endangered Species Act, Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the project-level conformity requirements of the Clean Air Act, and other federal environmental laws and executive orders that may apply to the particular project.  Mitigation measures are developed jointly by FTA and the recipient during the environmental review process to address federal environmental requirements as well as state and local requirements.  It is the responsibility of the recipient, in cooperation with the FTA, to implement those mitigation measure stated as commitments in the environmental decision document (i.e., the Categorical Exclusion (CE), the Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), or the Federal Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS)/Record of Decision (ROD).\nWhen FTA makes an Award, the mitigation measures are incorporated by reference in the Grant or Cooperative Agreement for the implementation of the project and the commitment to the mitigation measure becomes a condition of the Award that cannot be removed or substantively changed without FTA\u2019s written approval.  FTA regional staff monitors the implementation of the identified mitigation commitments through periodic reporting (e.g., quarterly reports), reviews of design, construction inspections, and special meetings, as necessary.  The recipient has the responsibility to apprise FTA at the earliest possible time of any problems in implementing the adopted measures and any need for changes.\nInformation about FTA\u2019s environmental review process is available through the FTA Regional Office.\nb. Project Management Plan.  A written Project Management Plan (PMP) is required by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5327 for all major capital projects.  Recipients are required to develop and\nimplement a PMP for all major capital projects financed by FTA as part of the Project Management Oversight (PMO) Program.  This plan covers a recipient\u2019s detailed project management strategy to control the project scope of work, budget, schedule, and quality (49 CFR part 633).  Requirements for the PMP can be found in the latest version of Project Management Oversight regulations and FTA\u2019s Web site at https://www.transit.dot.gov/.\nAs a general rule, if the project meets the definition of major capital project, the recipient must submit the PMP during the application review process.  FTA may also require a PMP to be submitted for other Award as deemed appropriate.  If FTA determines the project is a major capital project after the Award has been approved or if FTA determines that a PMP must be submitted for other projects after the Award has been approved, FTA will inform the recipient of its determination and will require submission of the plan.  An approval of a PMP can be made after the Award is made.\nc. Utility Relocation. (1) General.  The construction of transit systems may require the relocation and/or rearrangement of privately and publicly owned utilities.  These utilities include, but are not limited to, systems and physical plants for producing, transmitting, or distributing communications, electricity, gas, oil, crude oil products, water, steam, waste storm water, or other substances, publicly owned fire and police signal systems, and railroads and streets which directly or indirectly serve the public.  Relocating and/or rearranging utilities and facilities necessary to accommodate an FTA assisted transit project may be considered an eligible expense as part of the project.  Exceptions to this include those situations where state and local law expressly prohibit the financing of such by the public entity.\n(2) Eligibility for FTA Assistance.  In order to qualify for FTA assistance, the recipient must execute an agreement for relocating or rearranging facilities with the entity responsible for the facilities, which agreement prescribes the procedures for the relocation and/or rearrangement of the facilities for the purpose of accommodating the construction of the federally assisted project.  Prior FTA approval is not required in reaching a utility relocation agreement.\n(3) Utility Relocation Agreement.  These agreements are distinguishable from third-party contracts in that only actual allowable, allocable, and reasonable costs are reimbursable.  When the work is to be performed by the public utility\u2019s forces, no profit is allowed, and reimbursement is limited to the amount necessary to relocate and/or rearrange the facilities to effect a condition equal to the existing utility facilities.  Generally, reimbursement will not provide for greater capacity, capability, durability, efficiency or function, or other betterments or enhancements to the existing utility system, except for meeting current state and local codes.  The indirect costs of governmental entities incurred under a utility relocation agreement are eligible for FTA reimbursement only in accordance with an approved Cost Allocation Plan (CAP) as prescribed in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E.\nd. Force Account.  Force account is the use of a recipient\u2019s labor force as a capital expense to carry out a capital project.  Force account work may consist of design, construction, overhaul, inspection, and construction management activities, if eligible for reimbursement as a capital expense under the Award.  Force account work does not include Award or project administration activities that are otherwise direct project costs.  Force account also does not include preventive maintenance or other items under the expanded definition of capital (e.g., security drills, mobility management) that are traditionally not a capital expense.  Incremental labor costs for flagging protection, service diversions, or other activities under FTA\u2019s expanded definition of capital also do not need to be included.  Based on the amount of Force Account work, recipients may be required to submit a justification to use force account and/or the Force Account Plan for FTA approval.    (1) Force account work less than $1,000,000 can be performed without justification or a force account plan.\n(2) Force account work $1,000,000 or greater but less than $10,000,000 requires submission of a force account justification prior to Award.  A recipient must maintain a force account plan in its files prior to incurring costs.\n(3) Force account work at $10,000,000 or greater requires submission of a force account justification, as well as prior FTA approval of the force account plan.\nNote that a force account plan is prepared at the project level; it, therefore, may cover multiple Grants, Cooperative Agreements, or Amendments thereto.  It may be prepared prior to or subsequent to Award, but must be in place before incurring costs.\n(4) Justification of Force Account work.  A justification to undertake force account work is required to use the recipient\u2019s own labor force greater than $1,000,000 on a project.  One of four conditions may warrant the use of force account work.  These are: (a) cost savings, (b) exclusive expertise, (c) safety and efficiency of operations, or (d) union agreement.  The justification must address at least one of the four criteria. a) Cost savings.\nThe justification documentation must include the following information to be justified based on cost savings:\n1 A comparison of the present worth of the estimated cash drawdown for both the force account and private sector contract options;\n2 The recipient should use the current interest rate paid on one-year Treasury Bills as the discount rate;\n3 The recipient should include the cost of preparing documents, cost of administration, and", "doc_id": "d8fa140e-60df-420f-ab3d-c4ade22b7c7a", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "094fe840-74ed-4797-900f-d88bb3621481": {"text": " inspection, cost of labor, materials and specialized equipment, cost of overhead, and profit for private contract;\n4 Unit prices for labor; materials and equipment; overhead; and profit, if applicable for private contract;\n5 Certification that costs presented are fair and reasonable; and\n6 The present value calculation based on the midpoint of construction, and if the time for completion of the work differs for force account and a private sector contract, include an estimate of the cost of not using the completed improvement in the present worth calculation.  For example, if the work is to replace leased facilities, the cost of continuing the lease until the work is complete should be taken into account in the cost estimate for each option considered.\nb) Exclusive expertise.\nThe justification documentation must be based on exclusive expertise, and must include documentation equivalent to a sole source justification stating the basis for a determination that no private-sector contractor has the expertise to perform the work.\nc) Safety and efficiency of operations.\nThe justification documentation must include the following information to be justified based on safety and efficiency of operations:\n1 Safety considerations, which may be addressed by a statement of the transit operator\u2019s safety officer that performing the work with private-sector contractors would have an adverse effect on employee or public safety;\n2 Efficiency concerns, which may be addressed by a present worth calculation, including an estimate of the value of lost transit operation efficiency; and\n3 In emergency situations where the recipient uses its own workforce, the recipient may submit a waiver to the Emergency Relief docket.\nd) Union Agreement.\nThe justification documentation must include the information justified on the basis of a union agreement and must include relevant citations from labor union agreements and an analysis of how the agreements pertain to the work in question.\n(5) Force Account Plans.  Prior to incurring costs, a recipient must develop force account plans if it intends to use its own labor force in amounts greater than $1,000,000 on a project and retain the plan in its files.  If the amount is $10,000,000 or greater, the force account plan must be submitted to FTA for approval, including the following information and must be approved by FTA prior to incurring costs:  a) A description of the scope of work;\nb) A copy of the construction plans and specifications which includes a detailed estimate of costs and a detailed schedule and budget; and\nc) A copy of the proposed Agreement when another public agency is involved.\nSpecial care must be taken to ensure that requirements of 2 CFR part 200 are followed, especially for charging expendable property to force account projects and making sure that allowable costs are assigned to the correct activity codes.\nMost general purpose equipment and tools can be used in force account work and thereby benefit more than one project.  Therefore, the cost of these items normally should not be treated as a direct charge to the project.  However, an appropriate use or depreciation charge is an allowable indirect cost if otherwise provided for in the Award Budget.  Unusual circumstances may call for the purchase of specialized equipment that is unique to the force account work that is being performed.  If such equipment is required, prior FTA approval must be obtained.  The usual FTA equipment disposition requirements apply.\nThe progress and status of force account activities should be separately discussed in milestone/project reports, with emphasis on schedule and budget.\ne. Seismic Standards and Reporting.  New federally assisted buildings, and additions to existing buildings and bridges, built with federal assistance must be designed and constructed in accordance with state, local, and industry required standards or codes.  Before accepting delivery, the applicant is responsible for determining that the building complies with the seismic design and construction requirements and the recipient certifies to the same through the annual Certifications and Assurances, as required by 49 CFR part 41.\nf. Value Engineering.  Value Engineering (VE) is the systematic, multi-disciplined approach designed to optimize the value of each dollar spent.  To accomplish this goal, a team of architects/engineers identifies, analyzes, and establishes a value for a function of an item or system.  The objective of VE is to satisfy the required function at the lowest total costs (capital, operating, and maintenance) over the life of a project consistent with the requirements of performance, reliability, maintainability, safety, and aesthetics. (1) Applicability. a) Major Capital Projects.  VE must be used on major capital projects.  A major capital project is usually identified during the application process.  (See Chapter I, subsection a, \u201cDefinitions,\u201d for a definition of major capital project.)\nb) Non-Major Capital Projects.  Recipients are encouraged to conduct VE on all construction projects, including but not limited to bus maintenance and storage facilities, intermodal facilities, transfer facilities, railcar acquisition and rehabilitation, and offices, with the level of VE study to be commensurate with the size of the project.\n(2) Timing.  VE on a project should be performed early in the design process before major decisions have been completely incorporated into the design, at or near the end of project development.  Additional value engineering may be performed early in the engineering phase.  A VE study may not be needed for some project delivery methods such as design-build, if the bidders are required to provide the VE options (alternate concepts) as part of their proposals.  Some large or complex projects may need to conduct two VE studies.\ng. Reporting of Award Budget and Schedule.  Recipients with major capital projects are required to submit the following reports: (1) Project Budget and Schedule: Recipients of major capital projects must submit project budget and project schedule data to the FTA.  A major capital project is usually identified during the application process.  (See Chapter IV, subsection 5.b, \u201cProject Management Plan,\u201d for a definition of major capital project.)\n(2) Timing: Recipients with major capital projects are required to submit project budget and project schedule data at least once per quarter to the appropriate FTA Regional Office.  On limited basis, FTA may require a recipient to submit reports more frequently than quarterly.\n(3) Value Engineering Reports: Upon completion of a VE study on any major capital project, a recipient is required to submit the VE report to the appropriate FTA Regional Office.  Copies of the VE report form are available in each regional office.\nh. Constructability and Design Peer Reviews.  Peer review is a process used by the recipient in the planning, design, and implementation of capital projects.  The concept of peer review can be applied to any problem or situation where a second opinion can be useful to decision makers.  FTA encourages the recipient to confer with other transit operations and maintenance experts in order to benefit from their experience.  These reviews have been used to review rail extensions, New Starts projects, and transit facilities.  These reviews have provided an in-depth critique of designs at the preliminary and final engineering stages.  They have provided operations and maintenance information with respect to a variety of subsystems and have validated the process used by a recipient\u2019s planning staff to locate bus facilities.\nThe purpose of constructability and design peer reviews is to improve the performance of the process or product being reviewed and optimize the design and subsequent construction of the project.  The review should be able to answer such questions as: Can this be constructed? Is there a better process that could be employed to achieve the desired results? Is the product safe? Although the recipient is encouraged to conduct peer reviews with all capital projects, in some instances it may be required by FTA, and the process should be fully documented through the recipient\u2019s document control process.\ni. Crime Prevention and Security Review.  Recipients are encouraged to develop, refine, and conduct training on security and emergency response plans.  Emergency response drills should be conducted with public transportation agencies and be fully coordinated with local first response agencies.  Other security training should be provided for public transportation employees that will serve to prepare an agency better during an emergency including such things as bomb threats, detection of chemical and biological agents, and other disruptive incidents.  Recipients are encouraged to perform crime prevention reviews during the design phase of all federally assisted transit facilities with particular focus on the incorporation and use of crime prevention through environmental design techniques.\nThis review should serve to improve and increase the safety and security of an existing or planned transit system or facility for both transit patrons and transit employees.  The level of review should be commensurate with the project size and scope of work.  Local crime prevention professionals should be included in the review process.  Review documentation should remain on file by the recipient and be available for FTA review upon request.  Safety and security publications and training information can be found at\nwww.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/safety/transit-safety-oversight-tso and at safety.fta.dot.gov/cms/welcome.\nj. Concurrent Non-Project Activities.  Concurrent non-project activities, also known as betterments, are improvements to the transit project within an Award sought by the recipient that are not part of the base functioning of the federal transit Award.  They are not integral to the base functi", "doc_id": "094fe840-74ed-4797-900f-d88bb3621481", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "b83006b5-114a-445d-8682-75cc3eb26010": {"text": "oning of the Award and are viewed as enhancements or upgrades to a level beyond what is normally required for the base functioning of the transit Award.\nThe concurrent non-project activities are performed in conjunction with federally assisted work under the Award to afford the opportunity to have the non-project work performed economically and efficiently in conjunction with federally assisted project work.  Examples of betterments include increased utility pipe sizes, road widening projects for local reasons, environmental mitigation measures not identified in an environmental document, increased landscaping, signal upgrades beyond the base requirements of the transit project, etc.  Costs for concurrent non-project activities are to be paid for by the recipient.\nThese costs must be accounted for separately and reported to the FTA separately from the reporting requirements of the Award.  Related but different than concurrent non-project activities are activities involving an overbuild situation.  Guidance should be obtained\nfrom the FTA Regional Office related to any overbuild situation to determine the federal eligibility of such an activity.  An example of an over-build situation is over-designing the foundation and base stories of a multi-story facility in order to accommodate better future vertical expansion of the project.  Outside a joint development project, such an over-build is generally not an allowable cost.\nk. FTA Technical and Construction Oversight Review.  The recipient agrees to permit FTA to review, as FTA deems necessary, the technical plans and specifications of a project to ensure proper execution, consistency with the scope of work and need, and incorporation of FTA requirements.  The recipient agrees to comply with any FTA requests, including recommendations and determinations pertaining to its review of construction plans and specifications.  The FTA Regional Office should be consulted to determine if FTA review of construction plans and specifications is necessary to advance the project to the next level of design.  The recipient agrees to provide and maintain competent and adequate engineering supervision at the construction site to ensure that the completed work conforms to the plans and specifications and that the intent of the scope of work of the Award is carried out.  To the extent applicable, the recipient agrees to comply with FTA PMO regulations, 49 CFR part 633.\nl. Energy Conservation.  The recipient agrees to comply with applicable mandatory energy efficiency standards and policies of applicable state energy conservation plans issued in accordance with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321 et seq.  The recipient, to the extent applicable, agrees to perform an energy assessment for any building constructed, reconstructed, or modified with FTA assistance, as provided in FTA regulations, \u201cRequirements for Energy Assessments,\u201d 49 CFR part 622, subpart C.  FTA assistance for the construction, reconstruction, or modification of buildings for which applications are submitted to FTA will be approved only after the completion of an energy assessment.  An energy assessment shall consist of an analysis of the total energy requirements of a building, within the scope of work of the proposed construction activity and at a level commensurate with the project size and scope of work.  The energy assessment should consider overall design of the facility or modification, materials and techniques used in construction or rehabilitation, special innovative conservation features that may be used, fuel requirements for heating, cooling, and operations essential to the function of the structure, projected over the life of the facility and including projected costs of this fuel, and energy to be used.\nm. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS).  Recipients that have transportation projects that include ITS must be participants in a regional or statewide ITS Architecture process and their ITS projects must be included in the locally approved Regional ITS Architecture.  Recipients are required to use a Systems Engineering process for the development of ITS projects.\nThe project level requirements include undergoing a Systems Engineering Analysis for the ITS and communications components of the project or Award, and developing ITS Project Architectures for all major ITS projects (prior to the adoption of the regional ITS architecture).  The ITS components and FTA National ITS Architecture Consistency Policy for Transit Projects conformity status also should be included in applications for\nfederal assistance within FTA\u2019s electronic award management system.  The policy can be found at www.transit.dot.gov/research-innovation/national-its-architecture-consistency-policy-transit-projects.\nA systems engineering analysis is a \u201cstructured process for arriving at a final design of a system,\u201d and is a method for identifying needs and developing/procuring the best possible configuration for a particular situation.  The policy requires that the systems engineering analysis includes how the project fits into the regional (or national) ITS architecture, how the system will be implemented and operated (roles, requirements), and analyses of alternatives for system configuration, financing, and procurement.  Applicable (DOT-developed and supported) ITS standards also must be identified.\nPrior to the adoption of a regional ITS architecture, all Awards with major ITS projects must also include the development of a project level architecture.  Major ITS projects are any projects that implement part of a regional ITS initiative that is multi-jurisdictional, multi-modal, or otherwise affects regional integration of ITS systems.  Examples include regional traveler information, regional electronic payment, new AVL systems that may set the standard for the region, or transit signal priority systems.  A project architecture is similar to a regional ITS architecture but focuses on the project and its implementation.  Again, all agreements that are needed to implement and operate the ITS systems must be included as part of the project architecture.\nn. $1 Coin Requirements.  The recipient agrees that its equipment and facilities will be fully capable of accepting and dispensing $1 coins when coins or currency are required to use that equipment or those facilities, and that the recipient will display signs and notices of the $1 coin capability.\no. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  New facilities, vehicles, and additions and/or alterations to existing facilities and vehicles are required to comply with regulations issued by DOT implementing the transportation provisions of ADA (49 CFR parts 27, 37, 38, and 39).  Recipients are advised to consult appropriate FTA circulars, DOT guidance, and other official federal guidance.  Any new construction or alteration to a facility built after the enactment of the ADA must comply with all ADA requirements.  Alterations to pre-ADA facilities are required to include improvements to facility accessibility, to varying extents.  Recipients should consult with the applicable regional office and Office of Civil Rights to determine the requirements for accessibility improvements for alterations to pre-ADA facilities.  Compliance is a condition of eligibility for federal assistance required by 49 CFR part 27, and is required whether or not the facility or alteration is federally assisted.  Depending upon the nature of the facility, compliance with implementing regulations issued by other federal agencies with ADA responsibilities may also be required.  The applicant is responsible for ensuring that new facilities, vehicles and additions/alterations to existing facilities and vehicles are designed in accordance with DOT and ADA regulations and related guidance in effect as of the date construction begins and for verifying compliance prior to accepting delivery.\nFTA OVERSIGHT\n1. GENERAL.  The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) evaluates recipient adherence to program and administrative requirements through a comprehensive oversight program.  FTA\u2019s Master Agreement, which is made available to each recipient through FTA\u2019s Web site (www.transit.dot.gov/), specifies these requirements.  FTA determines compliance through self-certification, oversight review, audits, and site visits.\n2. PROGRAM OVERSIGHT.    a. Comprehensive Reviews.  FTA\u2019s comprehensive oversight reviews take a broad look at its recipients\u2019 management practices as well as compliance with program and administrative requirements across a broad spectrum of topic areas in accordance with 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.  In addition to helping evaluate grantees, these reviews give FTA an opportunity to provide technical assistance for meeting FTA requirements and aid FTA in reporting to the Secretary, Congress, other oversight agencies, and the transit community on FTA programs.\nFederal law requires the FTA to review recipients of Section 5307 funds at least every three years.  Known as the Triennial Review, these comprehensive reviews allow FTA to meet its statutory obligation to review and evaluate recipients by looking at compliance across a variety of topic areas including financial management and capacity, technical capacity, maintenance, procurement, civil rights, and others.  For recipients of federal funds through programs other than Section 5307, including Sections 5309, 5310, 5311, 5329, 5339, and other sections of 49 U.S.C. chapter 53, the FTA conducts comprehensive oversight reviews following a similar format to the Triennial Review.\nb. Specialized Reviews.  In addition to comprehensive oversight reviews, FTA conducts specialized oversight reviews.  Specialized reviews can occur within the context of a comprehensive review or as a separate review.  Major topic areas for specialized reviews include, but are not limited to, procurement, financial management, and civil rights.\n(1) Procurement.  Procurement fo", "doc_id": "b83006b5-114a-445d-8682-75cc3eb26010", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "a3106fe3-2a5e-4274-a4a6-21fcf33720ba": {"text": "cused reviews ensure that recipients are meeting the third-party procurement requirements and standards of the Uniform Administrative Requirements, 2 CFR part 1201 (which incorporates 2 CFR part 200 by reference).  Additional information on procurement requirements and standards can be found in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 4220.1, \u201cThird-party Contracting Guidance.\u201d\n(2) Financial Management.  Financial management reviews assess recipients\u2019 financial management and control systems as well as policies and procedures.  Full Scope of Work System Reviews determine whether the recipient has proper financial controls and checks and balances in place to manage and track federal funds and meet the requirements of the DOT\u2019s Common Rule, 2 CFR part 1201 (which\nincorporates 2 CFR part 200 by reference).  Financial Condition and Capability Assessments assess a recipient\u2019s financial condition and capability to maintain and operate the existing system.\n(3) Civil Rights.  Recipients and subrecipients of federal assistance must comply with Federal Civil Rights requirements under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, DOT regulations concerning participation by Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE), Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) requirements, and the transportation provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).  The FTA Office of Civil Rights conducts periodic reviews to ensure ongoing compliance with these requirements so that recipients and subrecipients may remain eligible for federal financial assistance.  FTA recipients should be aware, however, that they may be subject to civil rights requirements established and enforced by federal agencies other than FTA or DOT, and that some of these responsibilities exist independent of FTA or other federal funding.   a) Title VI Reviews.  Title VI prohibits discrimination by recipients of federal assistance on the basis of race, color, and national origin, including the denial of meaningful access for limited English proficient (LEP) persons.  The FTA Office of Civil Rights reviews recipients of FTA assistance to determine their compliance with Title VI, the DOT implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 21, and the Title VI program-specific guidance in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 4702.1.  This includes a review of the recipient\u2019s service standards and policies, public outreach efforts, process for conducting service and fare equity analyses, LEP compliance, and other efforts.\nb) DBE Reviews.  Under 49 CFR \u00a7 26.21(a)(2), each FTA recipient must have a DBE program if it receives planning, capital, and/or operating assistance, and will award prime contracts with a cumulative total value exceeding $250,000 in FTA funds in a federal fiscal year (excluding transit vehicle purchases).  The FTA Office of Civil Rights reviews recipients of FTA assistance to determine their compliance with 49 CFR part 26.  This includes a review of the recipient\u2019s triennial DBE goal, overall DBE program, transit-vehicle purchases, certification processes, and contract monitoring.\nc) EEO Reviews.  FTA recipients are required to have EEO programs in place to prevent discrimination against their employees or applicants for employment because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or age.  The FTA Office of Civil Rights reviews recipients of FTA assistance to determine their compliance with related federal transit laws (for example, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332(b)) and FTA\u2019s EEO Circular 4704.1.  This includes assessing a recipient\u2019s employment practices and policies, designation of EEO responsibilities, employment statistics and workforce analyses, and monitoring of EEO efforts.\nd) ADA Reviews.  The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability.  FTA is responsible for ensuring that providers of public transportation are in\ncompliance with the DOT regulations implementing the transportation provisions of the ADA, 49 CFR parts 27, 37, 38, and 39, which govern the design, construction, alteration and maintenance of transportation facilities; the design, acquisition, and maintenance of vehicles; and the operation of transportation services.  These requirements are further addressed in the most recent edition of FTA Circular 4710.1.\nThe FTA Office of Civil Rights conducts periodic compliance reviews of FTA recipients with regard to the following:\n1 Rail stations (key stations, new construction, and alterations to existing stations);\n2 Fixed-route service (stop announcements and lift and ramp maintenance); and\n3 Complementary paratransit (eligibility and service requirements).\n3. SAFETY OVERSIGHT.\nFTA is required under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5329 to establish a comprehensive public transportation safety program.\nPursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5329(f), the U.S. Secretary of Transportation is authorized to take actions to evaluate and direct changes in a recipient\u2019s performance of operations in order to improve the safety of public transportation systems.  The extent of these authorities and actions includes: (1) conducting inspections, investigations, audits, examinations, and testing of the equipment, facilities, rolling stock, and operations of the recipient\u2019s public transportation system, (2) making reports and issuing directives with respect to the safety of the recipient\u2019s public transportation system, and (3) issuing a subpoena to and taking the deposition of any employee of a recipient or State Safety Oversight Agency in conjunction with an accident investigation or an investigation into a pattern or practice of conduct that negatively affects public safety.\nPursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5329(g), the Secretary is authorized to issue directives, to require more frequent oversight of a recipient by a State Safety Oversight Agency or the Secretary, to impose more frequent reporting requirements, and to require that any federal financial assistance provided under 49 U.S.C. chapter 53 be spent on correcting safety deficiencies identified by the Secretary or the State Safety Oversight Agency.\nThe specific safety reviews are discussed below:\na. Drug and Alcohol Program Compliance Audits.  The purpose of the Drug and Alcohol Testing Program is to help prevent accidents, fatalities, and injuries resulting from the misuse of alcohol or the use of prohibited drugs by employees who perform safety-sensitive functions.  Establishing a testing program is a condition of federal assistance appropriated or made available for 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5307, 5309, 5311, 5339, or other programs as designated by the Secretary and any contractor of a recipient or subrecipient\nunder 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5307, 5309, 5311, 5339, or other program as designated by the Secretary.  For noncompliance with 49 CFR parts 40 and 655, the Secretary may bar a recipient from receiving FTA assistance in an amount that the Secretary deems appropriate.\nRecipients must certify annually that they are in compliance with DOT and FTA regulations concerning drug and alcohol testing, 49 CFR parts 40 and 655 respectively.\nFTA conducts audits of recipients and states to assess their implementation of 49 CFR part 655 requirements.  These audits provide in-depth reviews of recipient and state programs, and include a detailed examination of records and interviews with appropriate recipient personnel, their contractors, service agents such as employees of collection sites, medical review officers, substance abuse professionals, and third-party administrators.  FTA assigns staff and contractor support to audit recipients\u2019 drug and alcohol testing programs.  FTA uses data collected and analyzed from the Drug and Alcohol Management Information System (DAMIS) to assess and monitor recipients\u2019 programs.  FTA monitors industry drug and alcohol testing rates and results.  These audits are scheduled based on analysis of DAMIS information and annual recipient evaluation.  FTA manages this program using a Web-based auditing and reporting system.\nb. State Safety Oversight Program Audit.  FTA is required to monitor and evaluate compliance with FTA\u2019s State Safety Oversight Rule, 49 CFR part 659 and/or part 674.  FTA conducts triennial audits of each state oversight agency designated to implement FTA\u2019s State Safety Oversight Rule for the rail transit agencies operating in its jurisdiction.  For each audit, FTA assigns its own staff, plus contractor support, to review each state\u2019s program.  These audits are scheduled based on analyses of annual reporting information provided by the states and use the recipient assessment.  These audits provide in-depth reviews of each state\u2019s program, and include a detailed examination of records and interviews with appropriate personnel and their contractors, at both the state oversight agency and the regulated rail transit agencies.  The audits also provide a forum to recommend improvements to the effectiveness of the oversight program established by each state.\nc. FTA Voluntary Bus Transit Safety and Security Reviews.  To implement the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement signed by FTA, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the American Public Transportation Association, and the Community Transportation Association of America, FTA conducts voluntary safety and security reviews at bus agencies throughout the country.  These reviews assess each bus agency\u2019s safety and security activities against FTA\u2019s technical assistance baseline, and provide recommendations, effective practices, and model materials to support improvements in critical safety and security functions.  The Transit Bus Safety and Security Program is based on objectives designed to improve safety and security for passengers, employees, and others that share the roadways with America\u2019s urban and rural public transit bus operations.  The Program encompasses public transit bus agencies of all sizes, including urban, small urban, rural, tribal, and community transit, and FTA is committed to the broadest possible implementation of Program", "doc_id": "a3106fe3-2a5e-4274-a4a6-21fcf33720ba", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "86d0e147-0cd5-4532-bcfd-bd294ecb5492": {"text": " strategies and tools.\n4. PROJECT OVERSIGHT.    a. Capital Program Management Reviews (1) Cost, Scope of Work, Schedule, Project Management Plan and Technical Capacity, and Capability Reviews and Risk Assessments.  Some of the key activities that FTA performs include cost review, scope of work review, schedule review, project management plan review, and review of the management capacity and capability of the project sponsor, or recipient.  Several other reviews may be conducted based on the project requirements.  The reviews are generally based on the complexity of the project, the project sponsor\u2019s experience, the cost of the project, and/or a risk-based approach.\n(2) Project Management Oversight (PMO) Reviews.  FTA conducts PMO reviews for major capital projects.  The primary goal of FTA\u2019s PMO reviews is to ensure that the project sponsors, or recipients, have all the necessary processes and procedures in place to effectively manage and deliver the promised benefits of the project on time, within budget, and in compliance with all applicable federal requirements and the project management plan.  PMOC Contractors will, generally, undertake a quarterly project site visit unless concerns with implementing the project management plan results in budget or schedule risk arise.\n(3) Quarterly Project Management Meetings.  Quarterly project management meetings, between FTA staff and project sponsors, or recipients, may be instituted with selected recipients.  These meetings provide a forum for management briefings, status/progress reports, discussion of accomplishments and problems, and, as appropriate, an opportunity for site inspection.\n(4) Site Visits.  FTA may conduct on-site inspections of projects to evaluate the recipient\u2019s effectiveness in implementing the project in conformance with the Grant Agreement, Cooperative Agreement, or other agreement.  Inspection visits may be made, for example, to follow up on information received from the recipient about an event with significant impact on a project or to determine whether the recipient has adequately complied with civil rights laws, regulations, and agreements.  Inspection and concurrence by FTA in project work does not relieve the recipient of its responsibilities and liabilities as the responsible party for carrying out the project.  The meetings do not replace quarterly written reports, unless FTA grants a specific exemption.\nNote: As a result of its monitoring efforts or those of its designated agents, FTA may determine that a recipient requires additional or specialized oversight to address identified or potential programmatic, administrative, or financial concerns.  Supplemental oversight may also include the imposition of additional conditions on the Award or monitoring requirements.\nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT\n1. GENERAL.  This chapter discusses the proper use and management of federal assistance the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) expects its recipients to adopt and use.  Financial management is one of the most important practices in the management of federal assistance.\n2. INTERNAL CONTROLS.      a. Internal control means a process, implemented by a recipient or subrecipient, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories: (1) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (2) reliability of reporting for internal and external use, and (3) compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nb. Internal Control Over Compliance Requirements for the Federal Award means a process implemented by a non-federal entity designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the following objectives for federal Awards:  (1) Transactions are conducted in compliance with:  a) Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the federal award that could have a direct and material effect on a federal program, and\nb) Any other federal statutes and regulations that are identified in the OMB Compliance Supplement.\n(2) Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition.\n(3) Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in order to:  a) Permit the preparation of reliable financial statements and federal reports,\nb) Maintain accountability over assets, and\nc) Demonstrate compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the federal Award.\nc. General.  FTA payments to a recipient are made electronically to meet the federal share of eligible expenses incurred under the Award.\nThe recipient\u2019s execution of its FTA Grant or Cooperative Agreement requires the recipient to use the federal assistance it receives as specified in that Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  This creates a vested interest by the Federal Government in unused balances, any improperly used federal assistance, and facilities, equipment, or services purchased\nor otherwise acquired to implement its Award, whether the federal assistance received by the recipient is an advance or reimbursement.\nRecipients and subrecipients are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over all their functions that affect implementation of the Award.\nFor proper management of the Award, these controls must be used by each recipient in all its operating, accounting, financial, and administrative systems.  To ensure proper accountability for federal assistance, internal controls must be integrated with the management systems used by the recipient to regulate and guide its operations.\nd. Objectives.  Resources must be used in accordance with applicable state, local, and federal laws, regulations and policies, and the Grant or Cooperative Agreement accompanying the Award.  Resources must be safeguarded against waste, loss, and misuse.  Reliable data on resource use and safeguards must be accumulated, maintained, and fairly disclosed in reports to the recipient\u2019s management and FTA.  A proper system of internal controls will help the recipient to:  (1) Operate efficiently and economically;\n(2) Keep obligations and costs within the limits of authorizations and legal requirements, consistent with accomplishing the purpose of the Award;\n(3) Safeguard assets against waste, loss, and misuse;\n(4) Ensure timely collection and proper accounting of the recipient\u2019s operating and other revenues; and\n(5) Ensure accuracy and reliability in financial, statistical, and other reports.\ne. Necessary Elements.  Certain elements are necessary to achieve the objectives mentioned above in Chapter VI, subsection 2.d and meet the standards discussed below in Chapter VI, subsection 2.f.  The following objectives and standards facilitate the recipient\u2019s use of internal controls:  (1) Reasonable assurance that internal controls are an integral part of the recipient\u2019s management systems;\n(2) Existence of a positive and supportive attitude among the recipient\u2019s managers and employees;\n(3) Assignment of internal control functions to competent and experienced employees;\n(4) Identification of specific internal control objectives to ensure that needs are identified and that valid controls are planned and implemented;\n(5) Adoption of internal control policies, plans, and procedures that reasonably ensure their effectiveness, such as organizational separation of duties and physical arrangements, such as locks and fire alarms; and\n(6) Regular program of testing to identify vulnerabilities in the internal control system.\nf. Standards of Internal Control and Audit Resolutions.    (1) General.   a) Recipient management policies that govern implementation of the Award must be clearly stated, understood throughout the organization, and conformed to applicable legislative and administrative requirements.\nb) The recipient\u2019s formal organization structure must clearly define, assign, and delegate appropriate authority for all duties.\nc) Responsibility for duties and functions must be segregated within the organization to ensure that adequate internal checks and balances exist.  Recipients should pay particular attention to authorization, performance, recording, inventory control, and review functions to reduce the opportunity for unauthorized or fraudulent acts.\nd) A system of organizational planning should exist to determine financial, property, and personnel resource needs.\ne) Written operating procedures must exist and be simply stated, yet meet the recipient\u2019s operating, legal, and regulatory requirements.  In developing its procedures, the recipient should consider such factors as feasibility, cost, risk of loss or error, and availability of suitable personnel; other important considerations are the prevention of illegal or unauthorized transactions or acts.\nf) The recipient\u2019s information system must reliably provide needed operating and financial data for decision-making and performance review.\ng) The recipient must provide proper supervision and performance must be subject to review of an effective internal audit program.\nh) All personnel must be properly qualified for their assigned responsibilities, duties, and functions; education, training, experience, competence, and integrity should be considered in assigning work; all must be held fully accountable for the proper discharge of their assignments.\ni) Expenditures must be controlled so that construction, equipment, other property, and services are acquired and received as contracted for (as to quality, quantity, price, and time of delivery); authorizations for expenditures must conform to applicable statutes, regulations, and policies.\nj) All real property, equipment, expendables, and funds must be safeguarded to prevent misuse, misappropriation, waste, or unwarranted deterioration or destruction.\n(2) Internal Control Self-Assessment.  The recipient should evaluate its internal controls and financial management systems to ensure their effectiveness.  To assist with the evaluation, FTA developed an example of an Internal Contr", "doc_id": "86d0e147-0cd5-4532-bcfd-bd294ecb5492", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "6f29b834-d280-4257-8aab-049b5903f333": {"text": "ol Self-Assessment Form.  The optional form is designed to provide the recipient\u2019s management staff with the information necessary to evaluate the agency\u2019s internal control and financial management system.  The form is based on the criteria for effective internal control as set forth in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Committee (the COSO Report), as well as the criteria for effective financial management systems established by FTA, based on U.S. DOT\u2019s common rules at 2 CFR \u00a7 200.518, effective on and after December 26, 2014 and former 49 CFR parts 18 and 19 in effect before December 26, 2014.\nThe Internal Control Self-Assessment Tool can be found at:  https://ecihstp.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/05/16.-Internal-Control-Self-Assessment-Tool.pdf\n(3) Financial Management Systems.    a) States: A state must expend and account for the federal assistance it awarded in accordance with state laws and procedures for expending and accounting for the state\u2019s own funds.  In addition, the financial management systems of a state, recipient, or subrecipient, including records documenting compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions applicable to the Award, must be sufficient to:  1 Permit preparation of reports required by the general and program-specific terms and conditions, and\n2 Permit the tracing of federal assistance to a level of expenditures adequate to establish that such federal assistance has been used according to the federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Award.\nb) Entities Other than a State: The financial management systems of each recipient or subrecipient other than a state must meet the following standards:  1 Financial Reporting.  Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of federally assisted activities must be made in accordance with financial reporting requirements.\n2 Accounting Records.  Recipients and subrecipients must maintain records that adequately identify the source and application of funds provided for federally assisted activities.  These records must contain information pertaining to the Award or subawards and authorizations, obligations,\nunobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or expenditures, and income.\n3 Internal Control.  Effective control and accountability must be maintained for all cash provided to support the Award or subaward, real and personal property, and other assets; recipients and subrecipients must adequately safeguard all such property and must ensure that it is used solely for authorized purposes.\n4 Budget Control.  Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared with budgeted amounts for each Award or subaward.  Financial information must be related to performance or productivity data, including the development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or specifically required in the Grant or Cooperative Agreement or written agreement with the subrecipient.  If the unit cost data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be accepted whenever possible.\n5 Allowable Cost.  Applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) cost principles of 2 CFR part 200 for Awards made on or after December 26, 2014, and OMB cost principles for Awards made before December 26, 2014, as stated in former 2 CFR parts 220, 225, and 230, as applicable.  U.S. DOT program regulations, and the terms of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement or other written agreement with the subrecipient, must be followed in allowability and allocability of costs.\n6 Source Documentation.  Accounting records must be supported by such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, time and attendance records, contracts, and subrecipient documents.\n7 Cash Management.  Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the Treasury and disbursement by recipients and subrecipients must be followed whenever advance payment procedures are used.  Recipients must establish reasonable procedures to ensure the reports on subrecipients\u2019 cash balances and cash disbursements are received in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency.  When advances are made by electronic transfer of funds methods, the recipient must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of making disbursements.  Recipients must monitor cash drawdowns by their recipients to ensure that they conform substantially to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to advances to recipients.  Payment received from FTA must be disbursed within three business days.  If not disbursed within three days, funds become excess funds and must be returned to FTA with interest.\n3. NON-FEDERAL SHARE.  The recipient agrees to provide sufficient funds or approved in-kind resources to serve as non-federal share for all of its federally assisted Awards in compliance with 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.  The recipient certifies that it has or will have available the proportionate amount of the non-federal share to pay promptly the costs incurred or that become due to implement the Award, except to the extent that the Federal Government determines in writing that the non-federal share may be deferred.  The recipient may not use an amount as the non-federal share for more than one Award.\nDepending on the source of FTA funding, the non-federal share may include:\na. Cash from nongovernmental sources other than revenues from providing public transportation services;\nb. Non-farebox revenues from the operation of public transportation service, such as the sale of advertising and concession revenues (a voluntary or mandatory fee that a college, university, or similar institution imposes on all its students for free or discounted transit service is not farebox revenue);\nc. Assets from other federal sources if authorized by federal law to be used as non-federal share for the specific project;\nd. Amounts received under a service agreement with a state or local social service agency or private social service organization; and\ne. Undistributed cash surpluses, replacement or depreciation cash funds, reserves available in cash, or new capital.\nNote: Recipients should consult the applicable program circular to determine what sources of non-federal share are permitted for any particular activity.\n4. FINANCIAL PLAN.  Upon request from FTA, the recipient agrees to provide a financial plan delineating the source of non-federal share, the amounts applicable to the different sources, and the time frame for acquisition of the non-federal share.  Recipients must have multi-year financial plans (3\u20135 years) for operating and capital revenues and expenses to implement FTA Awards.  The financial plans should indicate adequate revenues to maintain and operate the existing system and to complete the annual program of projects (POP).\n5. FEDERAL PRINCIPLES FOR DETERMINING ALLOWABLE COSTS.     a. General.   (1) Recipients should refer to DOT regulations, \u201cUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\u201d 2 CFR part 1201, for Awards and amendments thereto with additional funding made on or after December 26, 2014, to Awards and amendments.\n(2) Recipients of Award made before December 26, 2014, should refer to former 2 CFR part 220 (OMB Circular A-21, \u201cCost Principles for Educational\nInstitutions\u201d); former 2 CFR part 225 (OMB Circular A-87, \u201cCost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments\u201d); former 2 CFR part 230 (OMB Circular A-122, \u201cCost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations\u201d); or the Federal Acquisition Regulations subpart 31.2 (48 CFR chapter I, subpart 31.2), which covers for-profit organizations.  While there are a few substantive differences between the new cost principles of 2 CFR part 200 and the former OMB cost principles, the differences are explained in the following OMB \u201ccrosswalk\u201d documents:  a) \u201cUniform Guidance Crosswalk from Final Guidance to Existing Guidance,\u201d A-21, A-50, A-87, A-89, A-102, A-110, A-122, A-133, www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/fedreg/2013/uniform-guidance-crosswalk-to-predominate-source-existing-guidance.pdf, and\nb) \u201cUniform Guidance Crosswalk from Existing Guidance to Final Guidance,\u201d www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/fedreg/2013/uniform-guidance-crosswalk-from-predominate-source-in-existing-guidance.pdf.\n(3) Apart from the cost differences identified above, FTA has determined that: a) The Program Income provisions of 2 CFR \u00a7 1201.80 supersede conflicting provisions of the Program Income provisions of 2 CFR \u00a7 200.80.  In addition, the profit provisions of the latest Master Agreement supersede the prohibition on profits of 2 CFR \u00a7 200.400(g).\nb) Project costs must specifically relate to the purpose of the Award and the latest Award Budget.  Recipients may incur direct and indirect costs.  Direct costs are costs that can be identified specifically with a particular cost objective and may be charged directly to the Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  All direct costs, even for project administration activities, must be adequately supported with proper documentation.  For example, all labor charges must be supported with T&A records.  Indirect costs are costs incurred for a common or joint purpose benefiting more than one cost objective.  Indirect costs must be supported by an approved Cost Allocation Plan (CAP) and/or Indirect Cost Rate Proposal (ICRP).\nc) Care must be exercised when incurring costs to ensure that all expenditures meet the criteria of eligible costs.  Failure to exercise proper discretion may result in expenditures for which the use of project funds cannot be authorized.  The guidelines contained in this document are general guidelines for determining allowable costs, and any program-specific guidelines take precedence over what is presented here.  Please refer to your specif", "doc_id": "6f29b834-d280-4257-8aab-049b5903f333", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "688e1e1a-b50b-4c77-bb2e-69fb42173e93": {"text": "ic program\u2019s guidance and circulars for more information.\nb. Allowable Costs.  The criteria that govern the eligibility of costs to implement the Award are listed below.  To be allowable under a federal assistance program, costs must meet the following general criteria:  (1) Be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient administration of the federal assistance program, be allowable under the principles contained in the OMB common rules and circulars and except as specifically provided in this circular, not be general expenses required to carry out the overall responsibilities of state or local governments.\n(2) Be authorized or not prohibited under state or local laws or regulations.\n(3) Be able to conform to any limitation or exclusions set forth in the principles, federal laws, or other governing limitations as to types or amounts of cost items.\n(4) Be consistent with policies, regulations, and procedures that apply uniformly to both federally assisted and other activities of the unit of government of which recipient is a part.\n(5) Be treated consistently.  A cost may not be assigned to its Award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been allocated to the Award as an indirect cost.\n(6) Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) appropriate to the circumstances.\n(7) Not be allocable to or included as a cost of any other federally assisted program in either current or prior periods.\n(8) Be net of all applicable credits.\n(9) Be adequately documented.\n(10) Not be incurred before its Award is made unless specifically provided for in a Letter of No Prejudice (LONP) or equivalent document approved by FTA, or in the pre-award authority as described in the Federal Register listing of the Annual Apportionments.\nc. Disallowed Costs.  In determining the amount of federal assistance FTA will provide, FTA will exclude:  (1) Any costs to implement the Award incurred by the recipient before the date of the Award, unless specifically provided for in a LONP or equivalent document approved by FTA, or in the pre-award authority as described in the Federal Register listing of the Annual Apportionments; and\n(2) Any costs attributable to property or services received under a contract or other arrangement that is required to be, but has not been, concurred in or approved in writing by FTA.\nThe recipient agrees that reimbursement of any cost in accordance with the indicated payment methods for its Award does not constitute a final FTA decision about the allowability of that cost and does not constitute a waiver of any violation by the recipient of the terms of its Award.  If the Federal Government determines that the recipient is not entitled to receive any part of the federal assistance requested, the Federal Government will notify the recipient stating the reasons.  Closeout of the Award will not alter the recipient\u2019s obligation to return any federal assistance due to FTA as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions.  Nor will closeout of the Award alter FTA\u2019s right to disallow costs and recover federal assistance on the basis of a later audit or other review.  Unless prohibited by law, FTA may offset any federal assistance to be made available under its Award necessary to satisfy any outstanding monetary claims that FTA may have against the recipient.  Exceptions pertaining to disallowed costs are set forth in FTA directives or in other written federal guidance.\n6. INDIRECT COSTS.     a. General.  Recipients that intend to seek payment for indirect costs must prepare a Cost Allocation Plan (CAP) or an Indirect Cost Rate Proposal (ICRP).  CAPs and Indirect Cost Rate Proposals must be approved by FTA or another cognizant federal agency.  Pursuant to 2 CFR \u00a7 200.210, a Federal Award must include identification of the indirect cost rate for the Federal award (including if the de minimis rate is charged).\nb. Definitions.  Indirect costs, as defined in 2 CFR part 200, are costs that are:  (1) Incurred for a common or joint purpose benefiting more than one cost objective,\n(2) Not readily assignable to the cost objectives specifically benefited, without effort disproportionate to the results achieved, and\n(3) Originating in the recipient department as well as those incurred by other departments in supplying goods, services, and facilities to the recipient department.\nExamples of indirect costs are administrative, operational, and expenses of unit heads and their immediate staff.  Principles and standards for determining costs applicable to Grants and Cooperative Agreements with recipient or other state or local government authorities are presented in 2 CFR part 200.416 and the appropriate Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) publication, ASMB C-10 (Cost Principles and Procedures for Establishing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government).\nc. Cognizant Federal Agency.  Cognizance is generally assigned to the federal agency that provides the predominant amount of federal funding with a recipient within a given state or locality.  (OMB has assigned cognizant audit agencies for state and local governments.)\nCognizant agency for indirect costs means the federal agency responsible for reviewing, negotiating, and approving indirect cost proposals or cost allocation plans developed under 2 CFR part 200 on behalf of all federal agencies.  Cognizance is generally assigned\nto the federal age ncy that provides the predominant amount of dollar involvement with a recipient organization.  Once designated as the cognizant agency for indirect costs, the federal agency must remain so for a period of 5 years.  (The cognizant agency for indirect costs is not necessarily the same as the cognizant agency for audit.) OMB has assigned cognizant audit agencies for state and local governments. The U.S. DOT is the cognizant agency for determining indirect costs for state and local airport and port authorities and transit districts.\nIn those cases in which a recipient is not assigned a cognizant agency, that recipient will be under the general oversight of the federal agency that provides it the most direct federal funds, which will also be identified as the cognizant agency for indirect costs.\nd. Plans and Proposals.    (1) The CAP is a plan that distributes the costs of a state or local government\u2019s executive and central level support functions to those operating organizations (usually at a lower tier level) within the government that benefit from them.  These documents are also referred to as a statewide cost allocation plans (SWCAP) or local-wide cost allocation plans (LWCAP).  All SWCAPs must be submitted annually to DHHS for approval.  DHHS is the cognizant agency for all states.  Unless required by FTA, or the cognizant agency, the local governments claiming central services costs do not have to receive federal approval.  Each major local government is also required to submit a plan to its cognizant agency for indirect costs annually.  All other local governments claiming central service costs must develop a plan and maintain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit.  These local governments are not required to submit their plans for federal approval, unless they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.  The costs approved under these plans may, at the option of the state or local government, be incorporated into the Indirect Cost Rate Proposals of a recipient agency within the government.  See Appendix F, Cost Allocation Plans, for further information.\n(2) The Indirect Cost Rate Proposal, which is a financial document that is updated annually at the operating agency level and which distributes the administrative support and/or overhead costs of that agency to the programs (and the Grants and Cooperative Agreements thereunder) that benefit from them.  An Indirect Cost Rate Proposal may include the allocable portion of state or local central service costs approved in the SWCAP/LWCAP.  See Appendix G, Indirect Cost Rate Proposals, for further information.\nRequirements for development and submission of indirect cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans are contained in Appendices III\u2013VII and Appendix IX of 2 CFR part 200, as follows:\na) Appendix III to 2 CFR part 200\u2014Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs);\nb) Appendix IV to 2 CFR part 200\u2014Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations;\nc) Appendix V to 2 CFR part 200\u2014State/Local Government-wide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans;\nd) Appendix VI to 2 CFR part 200\u2014Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans;\ne) Appendix VII to 2 CFR part 200\u2014States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals; and\nf) Appendix IX to 2 CFR part 200\u2014Hospital Cost Principles.\nRefer to Appendix G of this circular regarding additional information on Indirect Cost Rate Proposals and Appendix F for CAP information.\ne. Reporting Indirect Expenses.  If a recipient is charging indirect costs to its Award, the recipient must include the status of expenditures when completing its reporting requirements (quarterly, monthly, or annual, as applicable).  The information listed below must be provided in reports as expenses incurred on a cumulative basis.\nThe type of plan and rate must be consistent with the approved cost allocation plan on file, as approved by the cognizant agency, or as otherwise approved by FTA that permits reimbursement of these expenses.  The recipient should report expenses that are consistent with the rate indicated at the time of application and reflected in the FFR (See Appendix B for more detailed information and guidance on Federal Financial Reports.  See Appendix F for more detailed information on Cost Allocation Plans and Appendix G for more", "doc_id": "688e1e1a-b50b-4c77-bb2e-69fb42173e93", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "dcb6f946-934a-4b92-a616-99d4b2acc121": {"text": " detailed information on Indirect Cost Rate Proposals).\nThe information to be reported is:\n(1) Type \u2013 Enter indirect expense type (e.g., provisional or fixed);\n(2) Rate \u2013 The rate approved by the cognizant agency;\n(3) Base \u2013 The total base amount from which the indirect cost rate is determined;\n(4) Period from / Period to \u2013 The period covered by the approved rate;\n(5) Amount Charged \u2013 The total amount of indirect expenses charged to the Award on a cumulative basis; and\n(6) Federal Share \u2013 The federal share of the indirect expenses charged.\n7. PROGRAM INCOME.     a. General.  Recipients are encouraged to earn income to defray program costs where appropriate.\nFTA\u2019s program income policy for state, local governments, Indian tribes, and for institutions of higher learning and nonprofit organizations are at 2 CFR \u00a7 200.307 as modified by 2 CFR \u00a7 1201.80.  The \u201cProgram Income\u201d provisions of 2 CFR \u00a7 1201.80 supersede the \u201cProgram Income\u201d provisions of 2 CFR \u00a7 200.80, and as further described in the latest FTA Master Agreement.  FTA recognizes program income to be gross income (minus the cost of generating program income) earned by the recipient, or subrecipient, that is directly generated by a supported activity, or earned only as a result of the federal Award during the period of performance, per 2 CFR \u00a7 200.77.  The federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must include start and end dates of the period of performance in its Award.\nb. Program Income includes, but is not limited to, the following income:  (1) Fees for services performed;\n(2) The use or rental of real or personal property acquired under its Award;\n(3) The sale of commodities or items fabricated under its Award;\n(4) License fees and royalties on patents and copyrights;\n(5) Advertising/concessions specifically required by the federal Award, and pertaining to specific activities or accomplishments which result from performance of the federal Award; or\n(6) Payments of principal and interest on loans made with federal assistance.\nInterest earned on advances of federal assistance is NOT program income.  Except as otherwise provided in federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the federal Award, program income does not include rebates, credits, discounts, taxes, special assessments, levies, and fines raised by a recipient and subrecipient, and interest earned on any of them.\nc. Cost of Generating Program Income.  In determining the total amount of program income a Recipient has earned from its Project, those costs incident to earning program income that have not been charged to the Award may be deducted from the Recipient\u2019s gross income.\nd. Governmental Revenues.  Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and other such revenues raised by a recipient or subrecipient are not program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the Award, documents incorporated by reference into the Award, or federal awarding agency regulations as program income.\ne. Property.  Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment are not program income.  Such proceeds will be handled in accordance with the requirements of 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, \u201cPost Federal Award Requirements, Property Standards,\u201d 2 CFR \u00a7 200.311 \u201cReal property,\u201d and 2 CFR \u00a7 200.313 \u201cEquipment,\u201d or as specifically identified in federal statues, regulations, or the terms and conditions of its Award.\nf. Use of program income.  Unless FTA determines otherwise in writing, the Recipient may use program income earned during the period of performance of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement as follows: (1) The Recipient may retain the income for other capital or operating public transportation expenses. If the Recipient chooses not to use program income for current or future FTA Grants or Cooperative Agreements or for other public transportation purposes, then the amount of program income used for non-public transportation related purposes will be deducted from the total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs.\n(2) For each research-type project or related activities, the Recipient may add to the Award.\n(3) Depending on federal statutory or regulatory restrictions, the Recipient may use the program income for the non-federal share for a future public transportation Project that will receive federal assistance provided by FTA.\ng. Special Provisions for Program Income. FTA\u2019s programs have specific requirements for some types of program income and recipients should consult the applicable program circular for more detail about the use of program income under that specific program.\nFor example, for some FTA capital programs, revenues from the sale of advertising and concessions may be used as non-federal share and/or can be retained as part of a recipient\u2019s undisbursed cash surplus. For other programs, income from a service agreement with a State or local social service agency or a private social service organization to provide transportation may be used as the non-federal share for the Award in which the income is earned. In all other cases, program income may not be used to reduce the non-federal share of the Award from which it was earned, but may be used as non-federal share for future Awards.\nh. Income After the Performance Period of the Award. Except as otherwise determined in writing, the Recipient has no obligation to FTA regarding the disposition of program income earned after the end of the period of performance of the Award. FTA may negotiate agreements with recipients regarding appropriate uses of program income earned after the period of performance as part of the closeout process for the Award.\ni. Farebox Revenue. Farebox revenue may not be used as non-federal share for any of FTA\u2019s grant programs.  Farebox revenue is used to determine \u201cnet project cost\u201d for operating assistance grants only.  Farebox revenue is not considered program income for capital assistance grants. (See the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9030.1, \u201cUrbanized Area Formula Program: Program Guidance and Application Instructions,\u201d and the most recent edition of FTA Circular 9040.1 \u201cFormula Grants for Rural Areas: Program Guidance and Application Instructions.\n8. ANNUAL AUDIT.     a. General.  2 CFR part 200, subpart F Audit Requirements.  The OMB common rule, 2 CFR part 200 and the current OMB Compliance Supplement provide the requirements for annual audits of recipients, also known as the Single Audit.  Documentation regarding Single Audit requirements is available on the OMB Web site at: www.whitehouse.gov/omb/financial_fin_single_audit.\nb. Requirement.  In accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.501(a) and (b), recipients that expend $750,000 or more in a year in federal assistance from all sources must have a single audit conducted, except when they elect to have a program-specific audit conducted, 2 CFR \u00a7 200.501(c).  The audit must be completed and the data collection form and reporting package must be submitted within the earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor\u2019s report(s), or nine months of the end of the audit period.  If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, the reporting package is due the next business day.\nFTA recipients are required to obtain the services of an independent auditor to conduct a Single Audit each year in conformance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, except if a state constitution or statute provides for a single biennial audit or as permitted by 2 CFR \u00a7 200.504.\nRecipients are required to submit one copy of their annual single audit report to FTA if the audit report contains any findings and recommendations related to the FTA program or other DOT program findings.  In those cases in which the audit report does not contain any FTA findings or recommendations, a copy of only the Federal Clearinghouse transmittal sheet \u201cData Collection Form for Reporting on Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations, OMB Form SF-SAC\u201d should be submitted to the FTA regional or metropolitan office.\nRecipients must keep one copy of the data collection form and one copy of the audit reporting package on file for three years from the date of submission to the Federal Clearinghouse.  Pass-through entities must keep subrecipients\u2019 submissions on file for three years from date of receipt.\nc. Purpose.  The purpose of the single annual audit report is to determine whether the recipient:  (1) Has prepared financial statements that fairly present its financial position and the results of its financial position and the results of its financial operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\n(2) Has in place internal accounting and other control systems to provide reasonable assurance that it is managing its federal assistance programs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and\n(3) Has complied with laws and regulations that may have material effect on its financial statements and on each of its major federal assistance programs.\nThe annual Single Audit must be performed by an independent auditor who is required to determine and report on whether the recipient has internal control systems that reasonably assure that the recipient is managing federal assistance programs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nRecipients are required to determine whether certain subrecipients as described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.331 spend the federal assistance they receive in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  Audit judgment concerning the recipient\u2019s determination is left to the independent auditor.\nd. Resolution of Audit Findings.  Recipients and subrecipients are responsible for prompt resolution of all audit findings and recommendations.  This responsibility requires that the recipient:  (1) Promptly evaluate the report,\n(2) Determine the appropriate follow-up actions and establish a date for their completion, and\n(3) Complete all required actions within the established period of time.\nThe recipien", "doc_id": "dcb6f946-934a-4b92-a616-99d4b2acc121", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "6e980114-e884-4707-a86b-9ce40d3a468d": {"text": "t must resolve the deficiencies or opportunities for improvement identified in their audit.  The resolution of audits begins with FTA\u2019s report to the recipient and continues until the recipient corrects identified deficiencies, implements needed improvements, or demonstrates that the findings or recommendations are not valid or do not warrant management action.\nThe audit cannot be closed until FTA concurs in the documentation of steps taken to implement any needed corrective actions.  The status of outstanding audit findings and recommendations should be monitored and reported by the recipient in quarterly progress reports and, where appropriate, significant events reported.\n9. PAYMENT PROCEDURES.       a. General.  Provisions in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.305 and 31 CFR part 205 govern payments to recipients for financing operations under federal assistance and other programs.  These regulations require that advance payment to a recipient be limited to the minimum amounts needed and timed to be in accord with only the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient in carrying out the purpose of the Award.  The timing and amount of advance payments must be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient for direct program or costs of the Award and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.  The recipient must make timely payment to third-party contractors in accordance with the third-party contract provisions.\nb. Verify the Availability of Federal Assistance.  Before a potential recipient requests federal assistance, they should verify in TrAMS that the amount of federal assistance to be accessed is available for the Award.  Federal assistance should not be requested in amounts greater than the \u201cAvailable Funds\u201d reported in TrAMS.\nc. Payment Methods.  FTA makes all payments by the Treasury\u2019s Automated Clearing House (ACH) method of payment, regardless of the dollar amount involved.  ACH electronically sends payment to a payee\u2019s account.  The payments to recipients are made using various methods of payments.   (1) Electronic Clearing House Operation (ECHO) Payment.  ECHO is a FTA Web-based application system that processes drawdown payment requests from FTA recipients.  Recipients can access ECHO via the Internet to submit their drawdown request.  ECHO then transmits requests approved for payment to the Recipients financial institution through Treasury\u2019s ACH process.  For further information, see FTA\u2019s \u201cFTA ECHO-Web User Manual\u201d at: https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grantee-resources/echo/echo-web-user-manual\n(2) Requisition Payment.  If the requisition payment method is used, the Standard Form 270 (SF-270), \u201cRequest for Advance or Reimbursement\u201d form is required to be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration, Enterprise Service Center (ESC) in Oklahoma City, via DELPHI e-Invoicing System or DELPHI Markview system.  Instructions for completing SF-270 and the ESC\u2019s mailing address can be found in Appendix H.  FTA recipients that receive federal assistance through cooperative agreements may not process payments through the ECHO system.\n(3) Reimbursement Procedures for Research, Technical Assistance, and Training Programs.  See the most recent edition of FTA Circular 6100, \u201cResearch, Technical Assistance and Training Program: Application Instructions and Program Management Guidelines.\u201d\nd. Policy for ECHO Payments.  FTA makes all payments by electronic funds transfer, regardless of the dollar amount involved.  Payments are made under the electronic clearing house operation Web (ECHO-Web) system, by means of an ECHO control number assigned to the recipient.  The recipient agrees to comply with the ECHO-Web requirements contained in the Treasury Regulations, 31 CFR part 205, \u201cRules and Procedures for Efficient Federal-State Funds Transfers,\u201d specifically 2 CFR \u00a7 200.305, \u201cPayments,\u201d and as established by the \u201cGuidelines for Disbursements\u201d set forth in FTA\u2019s ECHO-Web system operations manual.\nDisbursement guidelines are in accordance with policies established in Department of Treasury Circular 1075, part 205, \u201cWithdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under Federal Grant and Other Programs,\u201d and by its FTA Grant or Cooperative Agreement.  These guidelines state that the recipient must commit itself to:\n(1) Initiating cash drawdowns for immediate disbursement (no later than three business days for disbursement).  Excess federal assistance held more than three days must be returned to FTA along with any interest earned.  See Chapter VI, subsection 9.f, \u201cRepayment to FTA,\u201d below for detailed information on requirements to remit interest.\n(2) Reporting large disbursements to the appropriate FTA regional office in advance of the transaction settlement date.  The recipient must provide a minimum notice of two business days for a disbursement totaling $50 million or more, and a minimum notice of five days when a disbursement of more than $500 million is anticipated.  When specific information has not been finalized, the recipient must inform the FTA Regional Office of approximate amount(s) and approximate deposit date(s).  The FTA Headquarters Accounting Payable Division should be notified by the Regional Office due to the requirement that FTA must provide the Treasury 48 hour\u2019s notification prior to drawdown of federal assistance exceeding $50 million.\n(3) Reporting cash disbursements and balances in a timely manner as required by FTA.\n(4) Imposing the same standards of timing and amount upon any secondary recipients.\n(5) Limiting drawdowns to eligible costs to implement the Award, which would include NOT drawing down federal assistance for its Award in an amount that would exceed the sum obligated by FTA or the current available balance for that Award.\n(6) Providing control and accountability for all federal assistance consistent with FTA requirements and procedures for use of the ECHO System.\n(7) Furnishing reports of cash disbursements and balances, when required by means of the FFR.\n(8) Recipients cannot return funds (overpayments/credits) for projects from which they have not requested funds in three or more years.  ECHO-Web does not support return payments with accrued interest, isolated return payments, or return payments too large to be offset by a requested amount.  Recipients who are not able to use the ECHO-Web system shall follow the repayment procedures listed in section 9(g) below.\ne. Excessive or Premature Withdrawals.   (1) General.  For excess payments made by the Federal Government to a recipient that does not qualify as a \u201cclaim\u201d for purposes of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3701 et seq., the recipient agrees that the amount of interest owed to the Federal Government depends on whether the recipient is a state or state instrumentality.   (a) A recipient that is a state or state instrumentality agrees that interest owed to the Federal Government will be determined in accordance with Treasury regulations, \u201cRules and Procedures for Efficient Federal State Funds Transfers,\u201d 31 CFR part 205 that implements Section 5(b) of the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990, as amended, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 6503(b).\n(b) A recipient that is neither a state nor a state instrumentality agrees that common law interest owed to the Federal Government will be determined in accordance with joint Treasury/DOJ regulations, \u201cStandards for the Administrative Collection of Claims,\u201d at 31 CFR \u00a7 901.9(i).\n(2) Exceptions.  The only exceptions to the requirement for prompt refunding are when the federal assistance involved:  (a) Will be disbursed by the recipient within seven calendar days, or\n(b) Is less than $10,000 and will be disbursed within 30 calendar days.\nThese exceptions to the requirement for prompt refunding should not be construed as approval for a recipient to maintain excessive federal assistance.  They are applicable only to excessive amounts of federal assistance that are erroneously drawn.\n(3) Return of Federal Assistance.  The return of federal assistance is accomplished as follows:  (a) FTA requests the recipients to remit the excessive cash and any interest electronically to FTA using the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Pay.Gov Financial Collection System (www.Pay.gov).  Once you have gained accessed to the Web site: (1) click on \u201cMake a Payment;\u201d (2) scroll down to \u201cSearch by keyword\u201d and enter \u201cFTA;\u201d and (3) choose the appropriate form (FOIA Fee, Grantee Refunds/Over Payments, or Vendors/Employees).\n(b) The recipient must provide the requested information and submit.  Note: If making an ACH payment from your bank account, please select ACH Direct Debit as the payment type.\n(c) Although paper checks are discouraged, recipients may mail refund checks to FAA (FTA\u2019s Accounting Service Center) in Oklahoma City.  If a single check is used to remit the premature withdrawal and the interest, the amount of each must be separately identified and accompanied by a letter explaining the purpose of the check(s) and identifying the federal award identification number or project number.  A copy of the check and the letter should be sent to the recipient\u2019s Regional Office.  Additional information pertaining to the mailing of checks is located below in Chapter VI, subsection 9.g.\nf. Repayment to FTA.  FTA program managers will be alert to any information that may indicate a potential repayment.  The following are possible reasons for payments becoming due to FTA:  (1) Insufficient eligible funds to match federal payments,\n(2) The sale of equipment acquired or improved to implement the Award, or\n(3) Excessive federal assistance in the account for the Award.\ng. Repayment Procedure.  Required repayments must be made promptly to FTA.  Recipients can submit repayments through the Treasury\u2019s Pay.gov Financial Collection System (https://www.Pay.gov) for all refunds and repayments.  Refunds by check should be processed using the following steps:  (1) Make the check payable to", "doc_id": "6e980114-e884-4707-a86b-9ce40d3a468d", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}, "921eb400-6844-4029-92c9-3f3b2e659378": {"text": " the \u201cFederal Transit Administration.\u201d\n(2) Mail all checks to the FAA/Federal Transit Account as follows: (a) Regular Mail: DOT/FAA (FTA Account), ESC, AMZ-300, PO Box 269041, Oklahoma City, OK 73125, or\n(b) Overnight Mail: DOT/FAA (FTA Account), ESC, AMZ-300, 6500 S.  Macarthur Blvd, HQS Bldg. RM 181, Oklahoma City, OK 73169, Attn: Rhonda Manuel (405-954-8195).\n(3) Specify the applicable federal award identification number(s) or project number(s) on the check.\n(4) Provide a written explanation as to purpose of payment.\n(5) Send a copy of the check and the explanatory letter to the recipient\u2019s regional or metropolitan office.\n(6) While ECHO-Web is primarily designed as a payment request system, the system can accommodate return payments recipients may need to make on a project if a return meets processing parameters.  The Department of Treasury does not withdraw funds from an organization\u2019s bank account, so any amounts returned via ECHO-Web must be netted against requested funds.  This means the recipient can make a return payment only if also making a new payment request on the same form, and the Total Requested Amount (which calculates the Request minus the Return) is a positive number.  Recipients who are not able to use the ECHO-Web system shall follow the repayment procedures listed above.\nh. Requirement to Remit Interest.  FTA\u2019s Master Agreement states that recipients must remit any interest earned on excess federal assistance the recipient has drawn down and failed to spend for eligible activities under the Award, or any federal interest held in excess of three calendar days.  Payments of interest must be made by using the Pay.gov Financial Collection System.\nUnless waived by FTA, interest will be calculated at rates imposed by the Department of the Treasury (www.fiscal.treasury.gov/) beginning on the fourth day after the federal assistance was deposited in the recipient\u2019s bank or other financial depository.  Upon notice by FTA to the recipient of specific amounts due, the recipient must promptly remit to FTA any excess federal assistance payments, including any interest due.\n10. DEOBLIGATION OF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE.  FTA reserves the right to deobligate unspent federal assistance before closeout of the Award.\n11. DEBT SERVICE RESERVE.  Transit agencies that use debt financing in the form of bonds are often required by the terms of the Bond Indenture to establish a Debt Service Reserve (DSR).  The Bond Trustee is required to establish a DSR with the proceeds of the bond issue.  Usually, the DSR remains untouched for the term of the bonds, and is used to make a subsequent debt service payment ONLY if the recipient has insufficient funds to do so.  If the DSR is used in this way, the recipient must replenish the DSR from its own funds and within the time frames outlined in the Bond Indenture or be in default.  When there is no default, the balances remaining in the DSR are used to make the last debt service payment to the extent of such balances.  Required DSRs may now be financed with FTA assistance.  However, to the extent of FTA assistance, any particular DSR may only be used to pay principal and/or interest on the bonds.  Therefore, recipients intending to fund a DSR with FTA assistance may also wish to include some non-FTA funds if the terms of the Bond Indenture allow use of DSR for other items, such as late fees or Bond Trustee expenses related to default.\n12. RIGHT OF FTA TO TERMINATE.  The recipient agrees that, upon written notice, FTA may suspend or terminate all or part of the federal assistance provided herein if the recipient is, or has been, in violation of the terms of the Award, or if FTA determines that the purposes of the statute under which the Award is authorized would not be adequately served by continuation of federal assistance for the Award.  Any failure to make reasonable progress or other violation of the Award that significantly endangers substantial performance of the Award will be deemed to be a breach of the Grant or Cooperative Agreement accompanying the Award.\nIn general, termination of any federal assistance for the Award will not invalidate obligations properly incurred by the recipient and concurred in by FTA before the termination date, to the extent those obligations cannot be canceled.  However, if FTA determines that the recipient misused FTA assistance by failing to make adequate progress, to make reasonable use of the real property, facilities, or equipment acquired or improved for the Award, or to honor the terms of the Award, FTA reserves the right to require the recipient to refund the entire amount of federal assistance provided herein or any lesser amount as may be determined by FTA.\nExpiration of any time period established for the Award, does not, by itself constitute an expiration or termination of the Award.\nNeither the receipt by the recipient of any federal assistance for the Award nor the closeout of federal participation in the Award shall constitute a waiver of any claim that FTA may otherwise have arising out of the Award.\n", "doc_id": "921eb400-6844-4029-92c9-3f3b2e659378", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null}}}}
